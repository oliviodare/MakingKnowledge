**Take-home message**: 
They build on top of their previous response ([2021-Felin et al](2021-Felin%20et%20al.md)) and keep on arguing that there is no such thing as hypothesis-driven, and more specific that those who argue for a data-driven science have an "overconfidence" in the power of data analysis alone.

## Reading notes

# Annotations  
> underlie the overconfidence in data analysis and hypothesis-free scientific discovery.

> We worry that the wealth of access to lower-level data (like genetic information) and powerful computational tools is leading researchers to be overly focused on low-level data at the expense of the exploration of various top-down mechanisms.
