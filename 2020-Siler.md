**Take-home message**: the author argues for a a blury line between predatory and non-predatory journals, providing philosophical, and most importantly, empirical evidence. He brings as evidence the different methods of so-called predatory journals, and how there is an overlap between them. 
[[there is no one definition of predatory publishing]] 

However, I am uncertain whether this is good-enough evidence: he already has a category which he analyses (he picks the journals in the Cabells blacklist). Wouldn't the point be more convicing if he uses also: 1) controversial journals (such as Frontiers and MDPI, which he does acknowledge); and 2) widely acknolwedged non-pretatory journals and see precisely the blury line between the two? A good source could be a whitelist of journals!
He also highlights the role of peer-review in constructing the notion of legimitacy.

## Highlights and notes


> The nature and extent of predatory publishing is highly contested. Whilst debates have often focused defining journals and publishers as either predatory or not predatory. Kyle Siler argues that predatory publishing encompasses a spectrum of activities and that by understanding this ambiguity, we can better understand and make value judgements over where legitimacy lies in scholarly communication.

> Predatory publishing has emerged as a professional problem for academics and their institutions, as well as a broader [societal concern](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06048-2).

> debate over what constitutes legitimate science

>  There is considerable diversity in the types, combinations and degrees of illegitimacy in questionable academic journals, which ultimately raises the question: is it possible to define predatory publishing in such a binary way?

>  This ‘predatory’ incentive structure is also uniquely ascribed to low and middle-status OA journals. In contrast, prestigious OA publishers and journals enjoy the benefit of having selectivity positively associated with value. High rejection rates, if not always quality, imbue prestigious journals and publishers with pricing power. As such, high fees in eminent journals may be criticised, but they would never be labelled as ‘predatory’, even if their business models may be economically exploitative.

>  Given the wide variety of individual and institutional values in academia, it is unsurprising that there have been [fierce debates](https://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/867) and [political maneuvering](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-Beall-s-List-Died-/241171) regarding predatory publishing.

>  To illustrate this point, I analysed 11,450 journals on the Cabells Journal Blacklist to assess the varying degrees of predatory activity undertaken by different journals, from examples of obvious illegitimacy with numerous severe violations of academic norms, such as fraudulently claiming editors and impact factors, to more moderate or minor violations, such as sloppy copyediting and poorly maintained webpages.


>  Due to the variety and complexity in the degrees and types of predatory publishing, this makes empirically and normatively drawing lines between legitimate and illegitimate publishing a significant challenge.

>  Further complicating definitions of predatory publishing, are the existence of what could be called grey journals and publishers, occupying quasi-legitimate niches between whitelists and blacklists. Such journals possess borderline, uncertain, contested and/or ambiguous legitimacy. Frontiers and MDPI are large OA-only publishers that are arguably exemplars of grey publishing. Both publishers have been [successful](https://danbrockington.com/2019/12/04/an-open-letter-to-mdpi-publishing/) in recent years, as evidenced by rising APCs, founding of new journals and increases in publishing volume. However, both publishers have faced criticism and controversy over business practices, particularly regarding excessively permissive peer review and subordination of academic functions to business interests (e.g., [this](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/open-access-publisher-sacks-31-editors-amid-fierce-row-over-independence), [this](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/open-access-editors-resign-after-alleged-pressure-publish-mediocre-papers), [this](https://transformativelearning.nl/2018/12/04/publish-and-perish-how-the-commodification-of-scientific-publishing-is-undermining-both-science-and-the-public-good/), [this](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2015/06/my-collapse-of-confidence-in-frontiers.html) and [this](https://twitter.com/bmwiernik/status/1234247737476030465)).

>  The role played by peer review is key to this issue. Despite being essential to the quality of a journal, peer review is often an opaque activity, with the journal brand acting as a [signal of quality and trustworthiness](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/93/1/355/2338228). Complicating matters, some predatory journals appear to conduct [some sort of peer review](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00709-x), while others do not.

>  One means solving this issue would be the wider application of [open peer review](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00500-7) as a way of demonstrating the quality of peer review and exposing poor practice

>  Evaluating obvious black-and-white cases of predatory publishing (for instance [here](https://gizmodo.com/sketchy-science-journal-publishes-article-titled-whats-1842924936), [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/us-judge-rules-deceptive-publisher-should-pay-501-million-damages), [here](https://boingboing.net/2017/11/20/predatory-journals.html) and [here](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7259207/scientific-paper-scam)) is relatively simple. How academics, librarians and their institutions handle the multiple shades of grey – and where they draw economic and professional lines between legitimate and illegitimate – in modern publishing will be a much larger and more profound challenge.
