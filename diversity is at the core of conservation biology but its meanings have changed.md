# diversity is at the core of conservation biology but its meanings have changed

Early on ([1985-Soulé](1985-Soulé.md)), biological diversity was posed as a inherently yet unfoundedly so good thing in Nature. Soulé said that while diversity cannot be "proven" to be 'good' nor we can understand why seemingly all biologists think so, we must retain it as a central "normative postulate" of conservation biology. He pretty much equated the normative postulates to the "individual's philosophy" as a sort of personal preference, something that could not be theoretically or empirically substantiated, but rather a sort of inherently good *a priori*. We can see this vision from:

> "In general, humans enjoy variety. We can never know with certainty whether this is based on avoiding tedium and boredom or something else, but it may be as close to a universal norm as we can come"

However, this seems to have changed since 1985. 'Biodiversity' was later posed as a scientific concept which needed a political application (and thus more on the line of [1985-Soulé](1985-Soulé.md) 'functional postulates' of conservation biology). We may see one thing unfolding from 1985 onwards: a move of 'biodiversity' as normative concept to a descriptive concept. However, the pre-given of this move is a separation between description and value. Already in 1985 that distinction had been made.
