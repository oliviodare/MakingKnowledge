## Reading notes


> “It is otherwise for social and conceptual histories. From their theoretical self-foundation, there arises a general claim which can be extended and applied to all special histories. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 308)


> “The investigation of concepts and their linguistic transformation is so very much a minimal condition for cognizing a history as its definition of having to do with human society” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 308)

Making the claim that conceptual and social history does not limit, or "narrow" (p308) the scope of the historical study, since concepts and people are the basics elements of any history.

> “The claim that all historical manifestations oflife and their transformations are to be based on and derived from social conditions has been advanced since the historical philosophies of the Enlightenment up to Comte and the young Marx. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 309)

Continuation of the previous claim

> “conceptual historiesl--obviously the expression comes from Hegel” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 309)

Unsure about the meaning of this --> has a footnote.

> “Indeed it turns out that the reciprocal entwinement of social and conceptual history was first systematically treated in the 1930's; one thinks of Walter Schlesinger or above all of Otto Brunner. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 309)  
> “And it is no accident that the "Annals," which came from an analogous research interest, provided the rubric "Words and Events" in 1930. For Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, linguistic analysis was an integral component of their social historical investigations. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 310) 

Koselleck setting precedents before himself

> “Society and language insofar belong among the meta-historical givens without which no narrative and no history are thinkable. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 310)

Very citable thing.

> “So at times, however, the wish to be able to conceive a total history creeps in. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 310) 

Not sure what is meant by 'total history' --> something like a positivistic, objective description of reality (non-pluralistic)?

> “As numerous and plausible as the empirical objections to a total history are, there is one objection against its possibility which follows from its attempt at autonomous thinkability. Because the totality of a history of society could never be represented by the totality of its language. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 311)

Yes to the comment above.

> “Social history or history of society and conceptual history stand in an historically conditioned tension, both refer to one another without being able to supersede each other. What you do is first said to you the other day. And what you say becomes an event as it escapes from you. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 311)

> “It is a characteristic of historical time that the tension between society and its transformation and its linguistic preparation and shaping is reproduced again and again. Every history draws on this tension. Social relations, conflicts and their resolutions and their changing presuppositions are never congruent with the linguistic articulations by virtue of which societies act, conceive themselves, interpret, change and form anew. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 311)  

Co-construction

>“As a being endowed with language, the human individual originated with social existence. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312)

> “No social activity, no political action and no economic action is possible without speech and reply, without discussion of plans, without public debate or secret utterance, without command--and obedience--or consensus of the participants or articulated disagreement of the contesting parties. Any everyday story in daily performance is oriented by language in execution, by talking and speaking, just as no love story is thinkable without at least three words--you, I, we. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312)  

REALLY GOOD! Citable for the co-construction of social by concepts.

> “As obvious as this is, it is just as obvious that this observation must be limited. What actually occurs is evidently more than the linguistic articulation which has led to it or interprets it. The command or the collegial resolution or the elementary cry to kill are not identical with the act of killing itself. The expressions of lovers are not merged in the love which the two individuals experience. The written rules of an organization or its spoken executive instructions are not identical with the action of the organization itself. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312)

And the limits of co-construction

> “The speech act which helps to prepare, cause and execute the act is not the act itself. Indeed it must be granted that often a word causes irrevocable consequences; one recalls Hitler's command to invade Poland to name a striking example. But precisely here the relationship is clear. A story does not evolve without speech, but it is never identical with it, it cannot be reduced to it. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312) 

Against reducing act to speech!

> “Thus, beyond spoken language, there must be other preparatory performances and manners of execution which make events possible. Here perhaps the region of semiotics, which goes beyond speech, can be named.” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312)

> “the power of its symbol ground into the behavior patterns of groups or of modern traffic signs: they all concern a symbol for speech which is understandable without words. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312)

good semiotrics example --> interpretation

> “All the symbols named can be verbalized. They are also reducible to language but their achievement lies precisely in that spoken language must be abandoned so that the symbols can evoke or control the corresponding actions, attitudes or patterns of behavior. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 312)

> “Thus there are pre-linguistic and post-linguistic elements in all actions which lead to a unit of events or to a story” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 313)  

Reasons why concepts and society (speech and act) cannot be equated (why act cannot be reduced to speech): pre-linguistic elements (semiotic symbols) and post-linguistic (geography, temporality, biology)

> “Discussions which have been uttered or writing which has been read and the events taking place in actu cannot be separated; they can only be divided from one another analytically” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 314)

> “When one is overwhelmed by a speech, one experiences it not only linguistically but throughout the entire body; and when one is silenced by a deed, her or his dependency on language is experienced all the more in order to be able to move again. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 314)

> “Even if in the performance of action and emotion language may be--at timesmmerely a secondary factor, as soon as an event has transpired in the past, language returns to being a primary factor without which no recollection and no scientific transposition of this recollection is possible. The anthropological priority of language for the representation of history taking place thereby takes on an epistemological status. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 314) 

Valid because the way we do history is through (mostly) written texts.

> “Certainly there are numerous extra-linguistic remains which give evidence of past events and situations: ruins from catastrophics; coins from economic organization; buildings which indicate community, rule and servitude; streets which show activity or war; cultural landscapes; work carried out over generations; monuments which testify to triumph or death; weapons which show struggle; implements which show invention and application; in sum, relics, respectively, 'findings'--or pictures--which can attest to everything at the same time. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 315) 

Non-linguistic historical sources

> “In this way we have stylized three types, which under the alternatives speech-action and deed-action either relate both to each other or, in the extreme case, thematize them separately. Epistemologically a two-fold task always falls to language: it refers to the extra” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 316)

> “linguistic connections of occurrences as well as--while it does that-to itself. Historically understood, it is always self-reflective. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317) 

Langugage as self-reflective.

> “diachrony ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317)

Need to look more into this aspect of diachrony/synchrony

Diachrony: study of language through time, in the context of history

Synchrony: study of language at a given point

> “Here too, as with the relationship of speaking and acting in the performance of an event, synchrony and diachrony cannot be empirically separated. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317)

> “Purely theoretically, all histories can be defined as permanent present in which the past and the future are contained--or, however, as the lasting meshing of past and future which constantly makes any present disappear. In one case, which is intensified on synchrony, history becomes depreciated as a sphere of pure consciousness in which all temporal dimensions are contained at once, whereas in the other case, which is intensified on diachrony, the active presence of human individuals would have no sphere for acting socially and politically” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317)  

Synchrony emphasises the irrelevance of the (historical) context, and thus of the past, future, but I would say, even the present!

In diachrony, no ("present" or "active", as he calls it here) presence makes sense without a (historical) context.

Very good and citable for the understanding of synchrony/diachrony

> “contained” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317) 

fixed?

>“the differentiation introduced by de Saussure between synchrony and diachrony can be analytically helpful everywhere, without being able to do justice to the complexity of temporal overlapping in spontaneously occurring history. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317)  

Not really understanding why it does not do justice, but does mention that this Saussure (linguist? historian?) is who came up with the distinction.

> “With this reservation, the analytic categories of synchrony, which tends toward the actual presentness of the occurrence at the time, and diachrony, which tends toward the temporal dimension of depths and is likewise contained in each actual occurrence, may be used. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 317) 

Even more citable and clear than the previous one

> “Now it is characteristic of social and conceptual history that both--even if in different ways--theoretically presuppose just this connection. It is the connection between synchronic events and diachronic structures which is investigated social-historically. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 318)  

! NICE, THIS IS WHAT HISTORY STUDIES!

>“And it is the analogous connection between speech uttered at the time, synchronically, and the given language which always acts diachronically, which is thematized conceptual-historically” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 318) 

Two languages?

Does this refer to synchronic as actor's category and diachronal as analytic category?
From the following discussion: NO.

> “A new concept may be coined which had never before expressed experiences or expectations which had been present in words. But it can never be so new that it was not virtually laid out in the pre-given language at the time and even drawing its sense from its conventional linguistic context” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 318) 

There is no word that defines something which does not make sense outside a social context

> “Without this, history is neither possible nor comprehensible” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 318)

> “This can be elucidated with one series of examples. Marriage is an institution which besides its pre-linguistic biological implications represents a cultural phenomenon that exhibits numerous variations in the entire history of humanity. Since it concerns a social form of two or more individuals of different sex, marriage is one of the genuinely social-historical topics ofresearch. At the same time it is obvious that something can only be discussed socially-historically if written sources inform us about how any given type of marriage has been brought to its concept. Then two methodological versions, in abbreviated model form, can be constructed. One is primarily oriented towards events, actions in speech, writing and deed--the other is primarily directed to diachronic presuppositions and their long-term transformation. Thus it looks for social structures and their linguistic equivalents. 1) So an individual event can be thematized, perhaps a royal marriage about which dynastic sources offer us abundant information; what political motives came into play, what contractual conditions, what dowry was negotiated, how the ceremonies were staged and more of such matters. Also, the course of this marriage can be reconstructed and recounted again and again with the sequence of events, up to the terrible consequences if, say, with the death of a spouse the succession allowed for contractually was followed by a war to decide it. An analogous, concrete history of marriage can also be reconstructed today from the personal circle ofthe lower classes-an exciting theme of everyday history which employs numerous, previously unused sources. Both times at issue are unique, individual histories which are likely to contain their unsurmoutable tension between happiness and misery and which in both cases remain embedded in the religious, social and political context. 2) Social and conceptual history could not do without such individual cases, but exploring them is not its primary interest. To characterize the second methodological version, both are oriented-again in abbreviated model form--towards long-term conditions acting diachronically which have made the individual case possible, and they investigate the long-term events which can be derived from the sum of individual cases. Applied in another way, they investigate structures and their transformation. They inquire about the linguistic givens under which such structures have entered into social consciousness, been conceived and also changed.” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 318) 

GOOD EXAMPLES OF SYNCHRONY/DIACHRONY AND THEIR USES ([☝️ biodiv--questions arising](☝️%20biodiv--questions%20arising.md)).
- SYNCHRONY: HISTORY OF EVENTS, PARTICULARS --> PART OF BUT NOT UNIQUE OR MAIN INTEREST OF SOCIAL & CONCEPTUAL HISTORY

- DIACHRONY: HISTORY OF STRUCTURES, CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW FOR SPEECH --> MAIN APPROACH OF SOCIAL & CONCEPTUAL HISTORY

> “They inquire about the linguistic givens under which such structures have entered into social consciousness, been conceived and also changed. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 319)

> “What has happened "factually"--and not perhaps linguistically-over the long-run in history remains social-historically a scientific construction, evidence of which depends on the credibility of its theory. To be sure, any theoretically grounded evidence must be submitted to the methodological control of sources to be able to maintain past factuality, but the character of reality of long-lasting factors cannot be adequately grounded from individual sources as such. For this reason, as in the train of Max Weber, ideal types can be formed which compile different criteria for the description of actuality so that presupposed connections can be interpreted consistently. So--drawing from our series of examples--the ideal types of a peasant and an underprivileged marriage and family can be developed, into which go the respective average figures ofbirths and deaths, the correlation to salary--and price indices or to a succession ofcrop failures, to the period of work and to the tax burden in order to find out how a peasant marriage and family can be distinguished from an underprivileged marriage and family and how they have both changed in the transition from the pre-industrial to the industrial age. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 320)  

In order to be able to compare across individuality, is not enough to compare explanations (what he calls here "theory") to the sources, because we still have the problem of overcoming and transcending categorization. This is why the solution of 'ideal types' of Weber comes into place.

> “It is not the individual cases themselves, then, but the factors which can be structured so that the economic, political and natural presuppositions--each according to the importance of salary and price structures, the tax burden or the yield of the harvest--become insightful of a typical marriage specific to a class. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 320) 

Put in another way, it is not describing the individual cases themselves, but the "factors" that can be able to explain them (that are structurally shared across classes, ideal types)

> “Up until now, our series of examples was deliberately selected on the basis of such clusters of factors that primarily extra-linguistic series of events could be structured diachronically and related to one another. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 320) 

The social history approach

> “But naturally there is yet another cluster offactors which goes into the history of marriages to be posed as "typical" than those named ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 320)

> “so far. These concern those factors which could not be investigated at all without interpretation oftheir linguistic self-articulation. With this we come to the required conceptual-historial procedures which-analogously to the differentiation of event and structure--must distinguish between actual speech and its linguistic pre-given nature. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 321)  
 
INTERESTING ANALOGY

**SOCIAL HISTORY**
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVENT (SYNCHRONIC) AND STRUCTURE (DIACHRONIC)

**CONCEPTUAL HISTORY**
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL SPEECH (SYNCHRONIC?) AND LINGUISTIC PRE-GIVEN CONTEXTS (DIACHRONIC?)

> “institutionalized rules and interpretative patterns ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 321) 

These are the diachronically-given (contingent) contexts that are investigated in conceptual history

> “Linguistically articulated givens extend from custom through legal proceeding to sermon, from magic, through sacrament to metaphysics without which (even if to a dwindling extent) a marriage would neither be agreed to nor conducted. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 321)

> “So dominating into the 18th century is the theological interpretation of marriage as an indissolvable institution established by God the main purpose of which is the preservation and reproduction of the human species. Matching this were the conditions pertaining to class perogatives that a marriage was only permissible if the economic basis of the household was sufficient to nurture and raise children and to insure the mutual assistance of the married couple. In this way, many individuals were legally excluded from the opportunity to agree to a marriage. As the nucleus of a household, marriage was only permissible if the economic basis of the household was sufficient to nurture and raise children and to insure the mutual assistance of the married couple. In this way, many individuals were legally excluded from the opportunity to agree to a marriage. As the nucleus of a household, marriage remained tied to class perogative. This changed in the wake of the Enlightenment which newly founded marriage by contract law within the Prussian common law (Allgemeines Landrecht). The economic ties with the past were loosened and the freedom of the spouses as individuals came to extend so far that divorce--theologically forbidden--became admissible. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 321)  

The marriage example once more. The "class perogative" was embedded implicitly in the notion of mariage. We can investigate with a conceptual history approach the changes in meaning of marriage (diachronic) which were not present if we were to study laws or theology itself (synchronic).

> “Common law had in no way relinquished theological or classperogative conditions, but the concept of marriage shifted--which can only be recorded conceptual-historically--by distinct nuances in favor of a greater freedom and self-determination of each partner. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 322)

> “For the determination of the relationship of social and conceptual histories it follows from this that they need and refer to one another without being able to coincide with each other. Since what was "factually" operative over the long-run and has changed cannot be derived entirely from handed-down, written sources. Theoretical ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 322)

The definition of co-construction

> “and terminological preparatory work is needed for this. And what, on the other hand, can be shown conceptual-historically--inwritten documents handed down--in fact refers us to the linguistically bounded sphere of experience and provides evidence of innovative breaches, intended to initiate or record new experiences. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 323)

> “If a concept, say of marriage, is employed, in it there are linguistically accumulated long-term actual experiences of marriage which have supported the conception. And the pre-given linguistic context like” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 323)

> “actual experiences of marriage which have supported the conception” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 323)

> “wise regulates the scope ofits interpretive strength. ” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 324)

> “experience stored linguistically” (Koselleck, 1989, p. 324)
