# relying on scientific facts to develop an ethic is problematic
#conceptnote


Scientific facts are not stable ("sometimes wrong", as [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) puts it). 

One example is of Leopold's relyiance on the 'fact' of the correlation (and almost identification) between biological diversity and ecological stability. This 'fact' (among other elements, some non-scientific) justified Leopold's defence of biodiveristy, but it turn out to not be such a 'fact'. 

## The question is: what role should science and scientific facts play in developing a given ethic?
