# relying on scientific facts to develop an ethic is problematic
#conceptnote


Scientific facts are not stable ("sometimes wrong", as [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) puts it).

One example is of Leopold's relyiance on the 'fact' of the correlation (and almost identification) between biological diversity and ecological stability. This 'fact' (among other elements, some non-scientific<sup>[!](#footnotes)</sup>) justified Leopold's defence of biodiveristy, but it turn out to not be such a 'fact'. The problematic is precisely to derive non-contingent ethic and values from the contingent enterprise of deriving facts from science: "Both facts and valuers are open to debate; both lie within the ecologists' ambit." (p. 15)

## The question is: what role should science and scientific facts play in developing a given ethic?

Or otherwise put ([1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), p. 15): 

## "How can one ever extricate what the natural world really tells us from what we wish the natural world told us?"

## footnotes
Leopold was a pluralist, and used a plethora of arguments. As in [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) (p. 16):
> Leopold knew that his was not the final word, but merely the prolegomena to a new synthesis. Like many who came after him, Leopold was a pluralist; he used many arguments or styles to make his case, so that he might convert as many readers as possible.
