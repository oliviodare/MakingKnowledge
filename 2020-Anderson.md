**Take-home message**: Aside the psychologisation of politics at the beginning, which I loathe, she does argue for and explain a democratic, expert-aided, political forums to come up to *policy* decisions beyond political identity. She draws an example from a decision that needed to be made about the forest in California, where they gathered environmentalist, loggers, and hikers and they discussed issues with the help of environental scientists and reached a consensus.
