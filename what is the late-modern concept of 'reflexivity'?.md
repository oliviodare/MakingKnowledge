# what is the late-modern concept of 'reflexivity'?
#conceptnote

I am still unsure about what the concept of 'reflexivity' means in the context of literature on late-modernity (for an evolving collection of related notes, see #latemodernity). As well, 'reflexivity' seems to be a prominent concept in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md)'s *Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture* (and for instance,
[2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md)'s chapter), and also in [2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md)'s paper on seed banks.
