# what is the late-modern concept of 'reflexivity'?
#conceptnote

I am still unsure about what the concept of 'reflexivity' means in the context of literature on late-modernity (for an evolving collection of related notes, see #latemodernity). As well, 'reflexivity' seems to be a prominent concept in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md)'s *Endangerment, Biodiversity and Culture* (and for instance,
[2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md)'s chapter), and also in [2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md)'s paper on seed banks.


## Plant crops, and two levels of reflexivity

In [2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md), we read a history of seed banks and learn about the paradoxical position of plant breeders and scientists during the Cold War in the EEUU. Different collectives had concers about diminshing crop diversity, which emerged in the context of plans for furthering an industrial approach to agriculture. There is a **phenomenon of social reflexivity** going on: scientists have knowledge about crop diversity, a kind of knowledge that helped them create higher-yield crops for use in industrial agriculture. This knowledge about diversity is also that which contributes to their understanding that the reliance on this higher-yield monoculture is risky and that itself contributes to a diminshed crop diversity. In a larger, institutional sense, we see that the field of conservation and the process of industrialisation are entangled in through a similar mechanism: the advancement of both (seed conservation & industrial agriculture) depended on each other (industrial agriculture depended of on conservation activities and tools, and conservation activities were funded in the context of projects that aimed at developing agricultural practice into an industrial approach).

We see here at play two levels of reflexivity: **social** reflexivity between the two collectives (conservation & industrial agriculture) and **semantic** reflexivity between the knowledge that making desirable hybrid crops from diversity, and the knowledge that the use of such hybrid crops destroys the crop diversity from which they are made of.
