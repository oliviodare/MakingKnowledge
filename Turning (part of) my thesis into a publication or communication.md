# Turning (part of) my thesis into a publication or communication


[My thesis](zotero://select/items/1_MANBHFK2)


## Roadmap

### Questions I need to address
- What is it that I want to say? What is my message? 
- For *who* is message?
- What kind of interaction/feedback do I want from this communication?


### Strategy (recommendations by Bert)

- I need to connect with the literature: history in itself is not enough.
- Leave no gaps in argumentation, no thing without sources.
- Less is more.


### Once those questions are addressed: what is the best platform to achieve these goals?


## Platform options

### ISHPSSB Biennial Meeting 2021 (Virtual)
[Link to the meeting](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=ISH&year=21)

Registration needed (300$), subsidies possible.

First impression: not very fitting, seems to be much internalistic biology researh.
