# Turning (part of) my thesis into a publication or communication

## Roadmap

### Questions I need to address
- **What is it that I want to say? What is my message? **
	- How commercial players placed themselves as partners in the resaerch effort, and the **porous** (not simply vague) relation between public and commercial science. In my case: not only the obvious manufacturers, but the context itself (*Nature*), which ubiqutuously presented it as a neutral forum "*of* and *for* the scientific community" (praphrasing)
- **Why is this important?**
	- Addressing the issue of commercialisation of research, and illustrating the indebtedness of public research to commercial enterprises, as well as describing how commercial enterprises define and mold scientific attitudes and research projects.
- **For *who* is message?**
- **What kind of interaction/feedback do I want from this communication?**

### Strategy (recommendations by Bert)

- I need to connect with the literature: history in itself is not enough.
- Leave no gaps in argumentation, no thing without sources.
- Less is more.


### Once those questions are addressed: what is the best platform to achieve these goals?

**[ISHPSSB Biennial Meeting 2021 (Virtual)](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=ISH&year=21)**
Registration needed (300$), subsidies possible.

First impression: not very fitting, seems to be much internalistic biology researh.  

**Dates**
Abstract Deadline: April 1  
Decisions: May 1  
Full Program available: June 1  
Practice Day: July 12
Event: July 13, 14, 15, 19, & 20

### Approach
- If I want to address the question of 'how did commercial manufactuerers placed themselves as partners in the resaerch effort' (and how did this come about), perhaps not only a synchronic analysis is important, but a diachronic: what changed before the advertisements of the 1970s? Was there a difference?
