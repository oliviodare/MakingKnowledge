## Roadmap

### Questions I need to address
- **What is it that I want to say? What is my message? **
	1. **In general**, I want to tell the story of how commercial manufacturers for laboratory objects *inserted* themselves in the printed forum of the scientific community in the 1970s, and the role of advertisements (their languistic style, fomat, uses, content, prices, management) in this social *insertion*.
	2.  **In specific**, this piece illustrates how university research is indebted to commercial enterprises, as well as describing how commercial enterprises define and mold 1) scientific attitudes and 2) the research process itself:
		1.  *Scientific attitutes and values*. I describre here how commercial companies attempted to insert themselves as an integral part of the academic community by reflecting the values that researchers sought. 
		2. *The research process*. I explain the historical relation between innovation and standarisation, and the role of commercial competition in framing and constructing this relation.
	4. I will argue for the need to address 'scientific advertisements' historically: these visual images need to be understood via their political, cultural, and economic contexts, but yet, they cannot be used as unproblematic visual cues supporting an argument.
 		<br>

- **Why is this important?**
	- **In general**, this paper is important because it addresses the phenomena of the commercialisation of laboratory research, and in specific, the commercialisation of the *research process* itself, rather than the commercialisation of the end-products of science. These paper contributes to the recent attention that historians of science have given to the increasing role of commercial companies in university science in the post-WWII scenario, and the effects of this process. 
	- **In specific**, the commercialisation of the biomedical research process has hardly been studied, and, as I will argue; it's an important historical phenomena on which processes such as standarisation, innovation, and replicability hing on. 
	- There are no studies that deal with scientific advertisements as *central* objects of study and advertisements. My aim is to sketch some methodological and historiographical pointers for future historical and sociological research.
		<br>

- **What are the elements I want to discuss, and how do they relate to standing research?**
	- Notion of porosity ([[Pritchard and Zimring 2020]]): how commercial players placed themselves as partners in the resaerch effort, and the porous (not simply vague) relation between university science and commercial partners.
	- In my case, not only the obvious manufacturers were commercial, but the context itself (*Nature*), which ubiqutuously presented it as a neutral forum "*of* and *for* the scientific community" (praphrasing). Here tying with the notion of 'forum' in [[Baldwin 2015]]
		- *Nature* as forum, identity of the community, but mediated by *Nature*'s editorial decisions. ``unclear about this, especially in terms of evidencial support from sources``
	- Missing indexation of advertisements
		- indexation as mechanism of construction of the professionalisation and legitimasy of research (no index, no science). ``not sure whether this is relevant for the main argument; literature could maybe be found in 'Gaming the Metrics'``
		- the inescapable value-laden aspect (digital) archives: there is no ads on the _Nature_ digitalised archive: we need to go to then physical sources. ``not sure about whether this is relevant for the main argtument; literature on archives by Lorrain Daston (among others)``
	- The relation between innovation and standarisation: commercial competition. ``I don't have (much) literature in mind: Cambrosio and Keating (Private Science)`` 
	- Advertisements need to be understood via their contexts, but they cannot be used as unproblematic visual cues supporting an argument. (the historian needs to co-construct a narrative). ``Fortun (Private Science), Sontag, Cooter``  
	- The need for an expansion of epistemic virtues into the topic of social legitimacy of reserach ``cultural historical epistemology (van Dongen & Paul) & politics of form (Csiszar)``
		<br>
		
- **For *who* is message?**
		<br>
		
- **What kind of interaction/feedback do I want from this communication?**

### Strategy (recommendations by Bert)

- I need to connect with the literature: history in itself is not enough.
- Leave no gaps in argumentation, no thing without sources.
- Less is more.


### Once those questions are addressed: what is the best platform to achieve these goals?

**[ISHPSSB Biennial Meeting 2021 (Virtual)](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=ISH&year=21)**
Registration needed (300$), subsidies possible.

First impression: not very fitting, seems to be much internalistic biology researh.  

**Dates**
Abstract Deadline: April 1  
Decisions: May 1  
Full Program available: June 1  
Practice Day: July 12
Event: July 13, 14, 15, 19, & 20

### Approach
- If I want to address the question of 'how did commercial manufactuerers placed themselves as partners in the resaerch effort' (and how did this come about), perhaps not only a synchronic analysis is important, but a diachronic: what changed before the advertisements of the 1970s? Was there a difference?
