**Take-home message**: the debates in philosophy of biology, and specially, in regard to the #speciesproblem  are varied. In fact, [there is no one ‘species problem’ with a dichotomous solution](there%20is%20no%20one%20%E2%80%98species%20problem%E2%80%99%20with%20a%20dichotomous%20solution.md). There are at least two: the realism of species as a concept (is Nature ordered in species?) and the realism about a single definition of species (can we come up with a single definition of what counts as species?). The former seems to be more complex, of the latter, most people are pluralist.

## Reading Notes

Book apparently a good introduction to the philosophical issues of species. Meant for biologists to think philosophically.

Kunz: realist about species in Nature, seemingly ontological realist without question

Reydon brings to the table that it is not only a matter of epistemic impossibility, but that within philosophy there is a discussion of whether species do exists as “unique real clusters of organisms.”

Kunz divides the debate in two: nominalism/antirealism vs realism. He seems to be lumping (and this is what Reydon criticizes) (anti)realism about species and (anti)realism about species concept. Most important take: _“Kunz takes for granted that we are faced with a clear-cut dilemma in the species problem: either monism combined with realism, or pluralism combined with antirealism.”_

Alternatives within the different #speciesproblem (some examples):

- pluralist-realist position about species: “Thus, one retains the idea of a unique division of organisms into species, but accepts that what makes a species in one region of biodiversity (e.g., for prokaryotes) may be quite different from what makes a species in another region (e.g., for mammals) which may be still different from what makes a species in yet another region (e.g., flowering plants).”
- pluralist-antirealist, or “promiscuous realism” (Dupré): “reject the idea that there is a unique division of organisms into species while still endorsing realism about the various possible groupings.” This is what Reydon himself defends, that there is no homogenous ‘species’ categories. 

Kunz provides another way of defining species: gene-flow. It’s a critique of the reproduction-based biological species concept (species are those that can actually or potentially give fertile offspring). Kunz gives vertical gene flow (from ancestors to descendants) and lateral (LGT in bacteria, but also sexual reproduction). With this revised versions of lateral and vertical, he proposes the definition that species are “communities of organisms held together by lateral gene flow,” which does forget about uniparental eukaryotes.
