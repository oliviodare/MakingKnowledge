## Thoughts, varied
- Historical question for [RUEDHA 2022 Ponencia](RUEDHA%202022%20Ponencia.md): Why did the project of huertos semilleros launch when there was a increasing ecological concern in ICONA?

Not much on the CSA. There is no information of mentioning of seed, seed production, or seed orchards within the CSA. While there is a forestry section within the council, the link with ICONA, INIA or any other independent institute within the Ministry, there is no one-to-one reporting of what goes on in these institutes to the CSA. CSA has its own missions and aims

There may be more interesting stuff in:
- T- huertos semilleros y repoblaciones: was there a shift on how seeds where managed in repoblations, or what were the sciences needed for them?
- T- knowledge demarcation: 

Learnt today:
- In the 1960s, the Vivero and Seeds Section of the Plague Service managed infections in the viveros. 
- In the late 1960s, seed tracking was already important. They used simple forms that needed to be filled by those producing or consuming seeds, by means of forms to be filled. Origin was traceable by coding categories.
