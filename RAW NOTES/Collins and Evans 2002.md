## Highlights and notes

> “‘the Problem of Legitimacy’ ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 237)


> “‘the Problem of Extension’” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 237)


> “Though science studies has resolved the Problem of Legitimacy by showing that the basis of technical decision-making can and should be widened beyond the core of certified experts, it has failed to solve the Problem of Extension: ‘How far should participation in technical decision-making extend?’ ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 237)


> “We start by sketching idealized models of what we call ‘three waves’ of science studies” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 237)


> “he First Wave of Science Studies had no Problem of Extension, ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 237)


> “and was unaware of the Problem of Legitimacy. It shows why the Second Wave of Science Studies was good for solving the Problem of Legitimacy that it inherited from Wave One, but replaced it with the Problem of Extension. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 238)


> “build a normative theory of expertise” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 238)


> “we will refer to members of the public who have special technical expertise in virtue of experience that is not recognized by degrees or other certificates as ‘experience-based experts’. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 238)


> “methodology ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 240)


> “In this strange sea, Wave Two continues to roll on, even as Wave Three builds up.” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 240)


> “The aim of this paper, one might say, is to hammer a piton into the ice wall of relativism with enough delicacy not to shatter the whole edifice (the destruction that so many critics believe is the only solution). ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 240)


> “As we have said, the Third Wave of Science Studies must emphasize the r ˆ ole of expertise as an analyst’s category as well as an actor’s category, and this will allow prescriptive, rather than merely descriptive, statements about the role of expertise in the public sphere. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 240)


> “‘expert’s regress’, by analogy with the ‘experimenter’s regress’. Because of the experimenter’s regress, the class of successful replications of an experiment can be identified only with hindsight; because of the expert’s regress, the class of experts can be identified only with hindsight. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 240)


> “Political decision-makers are, therefore, continually forced to define classes of expert before the dust has settled – before the judgements of history have been made” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “What we are arguing is that sociologists of scientific knowledge, per se, might also have a duty to make history as well as reflect on it; they have a r ˆ ole to play in making history in ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “virtue of their area of expertise – ‘knowledge’.” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “Wave Two deals with the ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “problem: ‘How is scientific consensus formed?’ Some form of relativism in respect of the outcome of that consensus is vital if the answer is not to risk circularity. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “Wave Three deals with the problem: ‘How do you make decisions based on scientific knowledge before there is an absolute scientific consensus?’ Wave Three does not replace Wave Two because the problems are different. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “But what we are trying to understand is why science should be granted legitimacy because of the kind of knowledge it is. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “In the case of this question, referring back to the way legitimacy is granted is what carries the risk of circularity. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 241)


> “This claim remains valid even for us, self-proclaimed, members of Western scientific society; indeed, one of the authors of this very paper was one of the first to describe the issue in print. How is this position compatible with the prescriptive statement we have just made, that in the case of esoteric sciences: ‘anyone who is not a recognized physicist with a great deal of equipment or special theoretical knowledge will not be, and should not be, counted as a member of the decision-making group?’ ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 245)


> “different role ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 249)


> “reconstruct knowledge, not rediscover it” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 249)


> “expert and political rights can be seen to be much more balanced ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 249)


> “Scientists, as scientists, have nothing special to offer toward technical decision-making in the public domain where the specialisms are not their own” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 250)  

there is nothing about ‘science’ as a unified whole, no ‘the’ scientific method


> “What kinds of expertise are candidates for reification?37 ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 251)


> “38 ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 252)


> “we have begun to understand expertise as an analyst’s category, as well as an actor’s category. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 254)


> “Now, for the farmers to have contributed to the science they would not have had to engage in a symmetrical conversation with the ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 255)  

Not symmetry, but extension


> “scientific experts – all that would have been necessary was for the scientific experts to try to learn from the farmers. This seemingly trivial point helps us to understand what expertise is, but also points out where the social location of change needs to be. ” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 256)


> “The scientists’ expertise was not at risk of being displaced by that of the farmers; it was, or should have been, added to by that of the farmers” (Collins and Evans, 2002, p. 256)
