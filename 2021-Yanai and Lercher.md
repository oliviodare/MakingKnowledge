**Take-home message**: 
Yanai and Lercher reposition their arguemnt and say now that conceptual, theoretical, and mental background do frame the way they look at data. They now claim that 'night science' (data-driven) and 'day science' (hypthesis-driven) are two ways you can do science and that they are both necessary. However, this argument still makes the case that they are two interralted (*yet independent*) ways of doing science, so arguing that it is possible to dro data-driven, hypothesis-free research.

## Reading notes

> For us and the rest of the scientific community, a hypothesis is the idea that one sets out to test. 

They reduce hypothesis to statistical hypothesis

> Our argument is simply that if you have an information-rich dataset, it will often be beneficial to analyze it with an open mind instead of with (or in addition to) the express or even pre-registered intention to test a specific hypothesis. In that sense, setting out to test a hypothesis may turn out to be a liability.

But is it often the case that people COLLECT data without a hypothesis? Can you do that in the current mechanism of research funding?

> Freed from semantics and reduced to its essence, the debate between us and FENKK boils down to the question of what comes first: the data or the hypothesis, day science or night science. While FENKK argue for a dominant role of hypothesis first, we stress that there cannot be primacy of one or the other. One project’s hypothesis comes from last project’s data and results. Over time, hypotheses and explorations form an eternal conversation, leading from prehistory to the “knowledge machine” that science is today .

With this response to the response, they don't seem so reductionistic: they argue for an equal ground between data and hypothesis, althought they still argue that they are 'independent' elements or research ("one or the other").
