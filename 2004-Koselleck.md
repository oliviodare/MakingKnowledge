## Reading notes
> "'Begriffsgeschichte' and Social History" ([Koselleck 2004:172](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=98))

Begriffsgeschichte = conceptual history ([note on p.172](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=98))

> "Without common concepts there is no society, and above all, no political field of action." ([Koselleck 2004:173](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=99))

> "they do not deal with linguistic history, even as a part of social history, but rather with the sociopolitical terminology relevant to the current condition of social history." ([Koselleck 2004:173](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=99))

> "The expression was novel," ([Koselleck 2004:175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=101))

> "pregnant with the future; it referred to a constitutional model yet to be realized" ([Koselleck 2004:175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=101))

> "infinite shades of meaning" ([Koselleck 2004:175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=101))

> "Surveying the space of meaning in each of the central concepts here employed exposes, therefore, a contemporary polemical thrust; intentions with respect to the future; and enduring elements of past social organization, whose specific arrangement discloses a statement's meaning. This activity of temporal semantic construal simultaneously establishes the historical force contained within a statement." ([Koselleck 2004:176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=102))

what can be achieved by looking at the meaning of concepts ([note on p.176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=102))

> "Expressed more generally, social conditions and their transformation become in this fashion the objects of analysis." ([Koselleck 2004:176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=102))

> "The struggle over the "correct" concepts becomes socially and politically explosive." ([Koselleck 2004:176](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=102))

> "ince the French Revolution, this struggle has become more acute and has undergone a structural shift; concepts no longer serve merely to define given states of affairs, but reach into the future" ([Koselleck 2004:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

> "the space of expectation" ([Koselleck 2004:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

> "political semantics" ([Koselleck 2004:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

> "interpretive key to its related concepts" ([Koselleck 2004:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

> "Here, Begriffsgeschichte becomes an integral part of social history." ([Koselleck 2004:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

> "From this there follows a methodologically minimal claim: that past social and political conflicts must be interpreted and decoded in terms of their contemporary conceptual boundaries, and the self-understanding on the part of past speakers and writers of their own language-use." ([Koselleck 2004:177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

MAIN CLAIM ([note on p.177](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=103))

> "Begriffsgeschichte is therefore initially a specialized method for source criticism, taking note as it does of the utilization of terminology relevant to social and political elements" ([Koselleck 2004:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=104))

> "It goes without saying that historical clarification of past conceptual usage must refer not only to the history of language but also to sociohistorical data, for every semantic has its link to nonlinguistic content" ([Koselleck 2004:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=104))

> "From the historiographic point of view, specialization in Begriffsgeschichte had no little influence on the posing of questions within social history. First, it began as a critique of a careless transfer to the past of modern, context-determined expressions of constitutional argument;8 and second, it directed itself to criticizing the practice in the history of ideas of treating ideas as constants, assuming different historical forms but of themselves fundamentally unchanging." ([Koselleck 2004:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=104))

conceptual history arising from the realization that concepts are not neither context-independent nor stable categories ([note on p.178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=104))

> "contemporary space of experience and horizon of expectation, and also to investigate the political and social functions of concepts, together with their specific modality of usage, such that (in short) a synchronic analysis also took account of situation and conjuncture." ([Koselleck 2004:178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=104))

what CH allows ([note on p.178](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=104))

> "during this second phase of investigation, are detached from their situational context, and their meanings ordered first according to the sequence of time and then secondly with respect to each other" ([Koselleck 2004:179](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=105))

first context, then meaning ([note on p.179](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=105))

> "Hence, the diachronic principle constitutes Begriffsgeschichte as an" ([Koselleck 2004:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

> "autonomous domain of research, which methodologically, in its reflection on concepts and their change, must initially disregard their extralinguistic content—the specific sphere of social history. Persistence, change, or novelty in the meaning of words must first be grasped before they can be used as indices of this extralinguistic content, as indicators of social structures or situations of political conflict." ([Koselleck 2004:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

unclear thus whether study of the context must be brought in first (compare to p82) ([note on p.180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

> "From a temporal point of view, social and political concepts can be arranged into three groups. First are such traditional concepts as those of Aristotelian constitutional thought, whose meanings have persisted in part and which, even under modern conditions, retain an empirical validity. Second are concepts whose content has changed so radically that, despite the existence of the same word as a shell, the meanings are barely comparable and can be recovered only historically. The variety of meanings attached today to the term Geschichte, which appears to be simultaneously its own subject and object, comes to mind, in contrast with the Geschichten and Historien, which deal with concrete realms of objects and persons; one could also cite "class" as distinct from the Roman classis. Third are recurrently emerging neologisms reacting to specific social or political circumstances that attempt to register or even provoke the novelty of such circumstances. Here "communism" and "fascism" can be mentioned." ([Koselleck 2004:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

three kinds of concepts, according to their stability ([note on p.180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

> "Within this temporal scheme there are, of course, endless transitions and superimpositions. The history of the concept "democracy" can for example be considered under all three aspects" ([Koselleck 2004:180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

something like this can also be said for ‘biodiversity’ ([note on p.180](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=106))

> "Persistence, change, and novelty are thus conceived diachronically along the dimension of meanings and through the spoken form of one and the same word." ([Koselleck 2004:181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=107))

> "Methodological restriction to the history of concepts expressed in words must have a basis that renders the expressions "concept" and "word" distinguishable." ([Koselleck 2004:181](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=107))

> "In use a word can become unambiguous. By contrast, a concept must remain ambiguous in order to be a concept. The concept is connected to a word, but is at the same time more than a word: a word becomes a concept only when the entirety of meaning and experience within a sociopolitical context within which and for which a word is used can be condensed into one word." ([Koselleck 2004:182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=108))

> "Concepts are thus the concentrate of several substantial meanings." ([Koselleck 2004:182](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=108))

> "It becomes plain here that, while concepts have political and social capacities, their semantic function and performance is not uniquely derivative of the social and political circumstances to which they relate. A concept is not simply indicative of the relations which it covers; it is also a factor within them. Each concept establishes a particular horizon for potential experience and conceivable theory, and in this way sets a limit." ([Koselleck 2004:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=109))

relation of CH to social constructivism ([note on p.183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=109))

> "The method of Begriffsgeschichte breaks free of the naive circular movement from word to thing and back." ([Koselleck 2004:183](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=109))

> "From this there flow methodological consequences. The investigation of a concept cannot be carried out purely semasiologically; it can never restrict itself to the meanings of words and their changes. A Begriffsgeschichte must always keep in view the need for findings relevant to intellectual or material history. Above all, the semasiological approach must alternate with the onomasiological; i.e., Begriffsgeschichte must register the variety of names for (identical?) materialities in order to be able to show how concepts are formed. So, for instance, the phenomenon of Säkularisationcannot be investigated solely on the basis of the expression itself.10 For the historical treatment of words, parallel expressions like Verweltlichung (secularization) and Verzeitlichung(temporalization) must be introduced; the domain of church and constitutional law must be taken into account historically; and in terms of intellectual history, the ideological currents that crystallized around the expression must be examined—all before the concept Säkularisation is sufficiently worked up as a factor in and indicator of the history to which it relates." ([Koselleck 2004:184](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=110))

elements to take, together with the meaning of the concept: e.g., other concepts, legislation, ideology, politics ([note on p.184](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VJG6WPIT?page=110))
