# conservation is a management science that has to deal with uncertainty
#conceptnote 

Conservation efforts are based on theoretical and empirical evidence to design artifical management approaches to the "longterm viability of natural communities". This is the aim of conservation biolgy ([conservation biolgy is a mission-driven science](conservation%20biolgy%20is%20a%20mission-driven%20science.md)). Artificial management is necessary to mantain biodiversity, as "bening neglect" is not a possibility "for the foreseeable future." And although [1985-Soulé](1985-Soulé.md) does not provide evidence of why management is so important, we can assume it's due to the way humans have interacted with natural resources for the recent centuries ([conservation biologists are aware and critical of industrialisation](conservation%20biologists%20are%20aware%20and%20critical%20of%20industrialisation.md))). 

Nonstochastic factors are a threat to the aim of conservation biology of being a management science. There are several factors that make environments unpredictable ("discontinuous, chaotic, suspended", "random"), such as the introduction of foreign species, very small population sizes, or temporal and geographical discontinuities. These nonstochastic factors are the forces that conservation biology has to manage.
