# how are classification systems used, by who?

What is the different meanings that different actors (scientist, policy-makers, environmentalists, NGO's) give of the classification systems and their different elements? And importantly, how does the context in which the utterance of the concepts of the systems modulate their meaning? This is perhaps a more refined and less naïve question as compared to [what is the process like (and how long does it take) since the scientific design of classification systems to their use in governance?](what%20is%20the%20process%20like%20(and%20how%20long%20does%20it%20take)%20since%20the%20scientific%20design%20of%20classification%20systems%20to%20their%20use%20in%20governance?.md).
