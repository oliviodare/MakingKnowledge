# Research Design Canvas (v.0.0.1, September 2021)

I originally saw this approach to begin a PhD project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WriteThatPhD/status/1426495653652353024), and there are several [other formats](https://www.academic-toolkit.com/the-research-design-canvas/). I've tweaked some of the questions to fit my specific project and my discipline(s).

 ## Research Question(s)
>What is the overall question(s) you seek to answer? 

How did the meaning of 'biodiveristy' evolve and adapt to the the contexts in which it was used (scientific advocacy groups, policy-makers, NGO’s, local communities) in the second half of the twentieth century?

How did scientific knowledge circulate among a variety of (not necessarilty scientific) actors in the context of understanding and managing the 'biodiversity crisis'?

>Why would answering it make a significant contribution to knowledge?

It is not well-known how and whether scientific knowledge is effectively implemented in managing the 'biodiversity crisis'. This research project should help to understand which social structures and mechanisms have been more efffective in ensuring a context in which environmental challenges can be addressed.  

##  Gap in Knowledge
> What is known about your topic?

My topic falls in between two main disciplines: philosophy and history. 

In the philosophy of biology and theoretical biology literature, current debates  focus on how the ambiguity in meaning of 'species' (the well-known 'species problem') and the widely different taxonomic practices have concrete consequences for reaching the objectives of biodiveristy conservation. The debates focus on whether a pluralist stance towards species at the conceptual level is warranted in scenarios where limited resources need to be assigned according to specific biodiversity measures. The main question that philosophers and biologists address could be formulated as follows: how can we ensure a fair, rational, and evidence-based asessment of conservation priorities when the tools that we use to assess the value of ecosystems and species follows non-standarised biodiversity measures and taxonomic practices? Philosophers and biologists often describe the situation of conservation biology as being in a state of 'taxonomic anarchy' ([2017-Garnett and Christidis](2017-Garnett%20and%20Christidis.md)) and of suffering from a 'taxonomic disorder' ([2019-Conix](2019-Conix.md)), and they often recommend that this chaotic situtation could be addressed by a top-down governance of taxonomic practice.


The topic of conservation biology and biodiversity conservation as treated in the historical literature mostly falls within the environmental history discipline, and more tangentially, within the history of science. One of the main studies is how the term and concept of 'biodiversity' came to be socially constructed in the second half of the twentieth century, leading to a concept that is not (only) a descriptive term referring to the variety in ecosystems, but a politically-laden concept mirroring the preservation goals of the field of conservation biology. Historians have looked closely at how, beginning in the Cold War, a certain environmental sensibility was developed through the construction and modulation in meaning of concepts such as 'extinction', 'environment', and 'biodiversity'.
