> "The assumption that species are fixed entities underpins every innterational agreement on biodiverity conservation, all national environmental legislation and the efforts of many individuals and organizations to safeguard plants and animals. Yet for a discipline aiming to impose order on the natural world, taxonomy (the classification of complex organisms) is remarkably anarchic." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

disconnect between science and political and interventionist practice ([note on p.25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

> "'Species' are often created or dismissed arbitrarily, according to the individual taxonomist's adherence to one of 2 at least 30 definitions . Crucially, there is no global oversight of taxonomic decisions — researchers can 'split or lump' species with no consideration of the consequences." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

Again, disconnect between unapplied science and the “consequences” of their work. ([note on p.25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

> "We  contend that the scientific community's failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss, damages the credibility of science and is expensive to society." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

same commentary as before, ilustrated by the comment ‘threatens’ ([note on p.25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

> "we propose that the governance of the taxonomy of complex organisms be brought under the purview of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS)." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=1))

> "scientific governance" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

interesting concept > will have to look at what it’s governed, and what it practically entails to ‘govern’ science ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "lack of universal rules for taxonomy has many consequences" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "Many mammalian taxonomists use the phylogenetic species concept (PSC): two populations are listed as distinct species if they have a common ancestor but differ physically or genetically2. Meanwhile, many bird taxonomists favour the more conservative biological species concept — the idea that true species should not normally produce 2 fertile hybrids" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

definition of ‘species’ seems also to be divided accross taxa / discipline.

May be interesting to look further into this taxa / discipline subdivission: is it really a matter of taxa (mammals versus birds) or rather a matter of disciplinary boundary making or tradition (mammal researcher versus bird researchers)? ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "Depending on which species concept is used, one class can seem more threatened than another, and so receive a bigger slice of conservation funding" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

Main argument.  ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "But if mammals are more finely split than birds, that means more money is being funnelled towards the protection of mammalian genetic diversity overall." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

continuation of the argument. ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "A second issue is that conservation legislation often fails to keep pace with changes to how animals and plants are classified." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

the argument again of the separation between science and application. In my case, science is going to be conservation science and application is going to be policy-making and regulation.  ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "Splitting species into smaller units means that more are likely to meet the definitions of being threatened, and so may increase a country's overall count of threatened species." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "a single taxonomic paper can affect whole conservation programmes, tourist enterprises and employment opportunities" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

This ‘scientific-determinism’ has to be investigated ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "The taxonomists driving such changes are not accountable to anyone other than their academic peers. And peer review provides few constraints." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

Free science versus accountable policy ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "techniques" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

science: technical ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "More than a decade ago, a group of conservation scientists identified the need for a stable 8 and agreed taxonomy for conservation" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

(seeming) origins of the push for standarisation. ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "Unlike the classification of organisms, the naming of animals and plants has been effectively governed by two branches of the IUBS for more than a century: namely, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT)." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

First —> what does ‘organisms’ refer to here, and why is it differenced from ‘animals’ and ‘plants’? SOLVED: nomenclature different from ’species’ definition

Second —> will need to check this organisations ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "Yet neither organization takes any responsibility for how species are defined" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "the freedom of taxonomic action" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

what a weird concept —> it illustrates the ‘scientific freedom’ in the science-policy dichotomy ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "the global reputation" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

social-consensus ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "FOUR STEPS" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

4 PROPOSED STEPS:- leadership- commission for all life forms- subcommissions for subsets of life- judicial committee that acts in cases of dispute ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "In our view, the IUBS should create a process that does exactly what that effort avoids — restrict the freedom of taxonomic action. And it should do so by creating boundaries for species (and other taxonomic units) that can be applied consistently across multiple life forms." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

Their main proposal (IUBS: International Union of Biological Sciences, branch of biology within the International Council for Science, “the highest-level organization for global scientific governance”).

I, however, don’t really understand the application of the second sentence (‘boundaries’, ‘applied consistently’, ‘accross multiples’) —> this seems to require standarisation procedures alike the ones proposed in [Conix 2019](Conix%202019.md) ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "Crucially, the microbiological committees acknowledge that species definitions are at least partly arbitrary human divisions of 2 natural continua" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

important, arbiratrianness does not prevent action, it’s a matter of consensus ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=2))

> "legitimacy" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))

> "Take the ongoing deliberations of the International Union of Geological Sciences about whether the anthropocene should be recognized as an official subdivision of the geological record (see Nature 519, 144-147; 2015). In 2016, geoscientists argued that social scientists including anthropologists and historians should be among the three-dozen people who will make the decision about the Anthropocene on behalf of human-" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))

Example of what they envision for all life —> should check out if it happened ([note on p.27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))

> ". The debate's vigour is healthy, and it ity should eventually be resolved at a conference in 2020." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))

> "If species delineations are at least partly arbitrary, deliberations must draw on expertise beyond taxonomy, morphology, systematics and genetics. Lawyers should be included to ensure that any definition can withstand legal challenge. And anthropologists and sociologists could advise on social equity, given that taxonomic decisions can dramatically affect people's livelihoods, particularly in low-income countries." ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))

only a final note on the plural kinds of knowledges needed for global consensus ([note on p.27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))

> "vagueness is not compatible with conservation. To protect biodiversity, laws need to compartmentalize it, and those compartments must have legally defensible boundaries" ([Garnett and Christidis 2017:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJSUN2UK?page=3))
