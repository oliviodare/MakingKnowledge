# Extracted Annotations (2021-03-02)

> "Each of these three major processes (the internet revolution, the economic transformation of #journalpublishing, and the evaluation turn)" ([ 2020:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=2))

*The three processes since the 1990s that provoked the ‘scholarly publishing crisis’ and the rise of the #OpenScience movement. Argument: it was “their mututal interactions” that created a “perfect storm.” ([note on p.2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=2))*

 

> "In this chapter, I propose a global macrostructural analysis that aims at showing how these different transformations have become connected as a consequence of the transformation of the paper from a #knowledge unit to an accounting unit used to evaluate researchers and research organizations (departments, laboratories, and universities)" ([ 2020:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=2))

*main claim, as in [Fernández Carro 2020](Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Carro%202020.md) paper. ([note on p.2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=2))*

 

> "This cycle is premised on the fundamental but implicit idea that the scientific paper is the embodiment of what we can call a "unit of knowledge,"" ([ 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=3))

*recognition cycle (Merton, Latour & Woolgar) implies science as a knowledge-making community, and the paper as one of its units. ([note on p.3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=3))*

 

> "its value and legitimacy comes from the social recognition and is not intrinsic to the submitted article." ([ 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=3))

> "symbolic credit allocation mechanism" ([ 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=3))

*citation ([note on p.3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=3))*

 

> "In this system, the obvious crucial step is #peerreview for it is at this very point in the process that the paper will exist or not as a socially recognized unit of knowledge circulating in the scientific field." ([ 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=4))

> "gatekeeping" ([ 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=4))

> "When the sientific paper will have been transformed into a simple accounting unit used for the evaluation of researchers and their institutions, we will observe the emergence and growth of various more or less deviant behaviors trying to cope with the multiplications of metrics through manipulating them or even the peerreview process itself." ([ 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=4))

*the so-called malpractices (“predatory journals,” faked peer review, the manipulation of citations to raise impact factors of journals and positions in academic rankings, and the rise in the number of “corrections” to and “retraction” of scientific papers) are the product of the scientific paper becoming an accounting unit ([note on p.4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=4))*

 

> ""knowledge management," which invaded the public sector in the 1980s and the universities in the 1990s" ([ 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=4))

> "the pressure to publish "accounting units" for evaluation purposes triggered a series of important transformations, synthetized in figure 2.2, that gave rise to new actors and new technologies of measurement" ([ 2020:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=5))

> "As papers and journals were being transformed into accounting units, journal publishing companies saw a new opportunity to market themselves as providing new evaluation indicators based on their own set of journals, while at the same time enrolling institutions to push their researchers to publish in their selfproclaimed "highquality" journals. The best example of such a strategy is the creation in 2014 of the "Nature Index," which ranks countries and institutions on the basis of the papers they publish in only sixtyeight journals, defined as "highquality science journals," and which include seventeen (25 percent) from the Nature group itself, owned by Macmillan and now merged with Springer, one of the largest publishers of scientific journals. This new ranking is said to offer "a perspective on highquality research on the basis of published articles" and to "provide institutions with an easy means to identify and highlight some of their best scientific research." ([ 2020:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=7))

*fucking ridiculous ([note on p.8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))*

 

> "This situation gave rise to "altmetrics," presented as an alternative to citation analysis, though they simply measure something different than citations" ([ 2020:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))

> "By broadening the spectrum of metrics, internetbased measures of the visibility of publications have also contributed to the rush to measure the "impact" of scientific research, even though the exact meaning of those "impacts" remains evanescent." ([ 2020:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))

> "By adding blogs and tweets to the array of metrics, one certainly gets tools to follow the diffusion of research results among diverse communities, but that does not say much about the quality or even robustness of the published results" ([ 2020:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))

*the accounting aspect of a journal has diversified its source: from citation and JIF, to tweets; but the fact that they consolidate the article as an accounting unit remains. ([note on p.8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))*

 

> ""impact"" ([ 2020:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))

*culture of impact-or-perish: ill-defined impact, well-measured. ([note on p.8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=8))*

 

> "One thing seems certain: the pressure to get faster results— and faster evaluation of results— has given rise to a reaction among scientists and the creation of the "slow science" movement (Berg and Seeber, 2016)." ([ 2020:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=9))

> "society should give scientists the time they need, but more importantly, scientists must take their time [...] to think, [...] to digest [...] to misunderstand each other, especially when fostering lost dialogue between humanities and natural sciences."" ([ 2020:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/42KSYS5H?page=9))
