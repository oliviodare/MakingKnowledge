**Take-home message**: This paper has an overview of the hotspots throughout the world. It may be a good starting point to look for case-studies, perhaps by comparing the situation between non-hotspot to hotspot. It has a very specific and pragmatic understanding of biodiversity, being open about its connection to funding, and the need for prioritization

## Highlights and notes

> “Conservationists are far from able to assist all species under threat, if only for lack of funding. This places a premium on priorities: how can we support the most species at the least cost? One way is to identify ‘biodiversity hotspots’ where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a ‘silver bullet’ strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world’s species at risk. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 853) 

The summary of prioritization, and setting priorities. [[one of the main issues of conservation biology is dealing with funding, which is dealt with by setting 'conservation priorities']] 

> “A prom ising approach is to identify ‘hotspots’, or areas featuring exceptional concentrations of endemic species and experiencing exceptional loss of habitat. Here we focus on species, rather than populations or other taxa, as the most prominent and readily recognizable form of biodiversity. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 853) 

Clear narrowing down of #biodiversitymeasures from [Sarkar 2002](Sarkar%202002.md) paper. [[biodiversity is narrowed to species richness due to pragmatic constrictions of conservation biology]] 

> “This is not to suggest that populations and even ecological processes are not important manifestations of biodiversity, but they do not belong in this assessment. There are other types of hotspot featuring richness of, for example, rare or taxonomically unusual species.” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 853) 

> “The hotspots’ boundaries have been determined by ‘biological commonalities’. Each of the areas features a separate biota or community of species that fits together as a biogeographic unit.” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 853) 

Definition of these hotspots --> it's not species richness

> “the expanded criteria require that a hotspot contains endemic plant species comprising at least 0.5% o f all plant species world-wide. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 854) 

> “The other vertebrate group, fishes, is excluded because data are generally poor (there could well be at least 5,000 species waiting to be discovered, or more than all mammals). Hereafter ‘vertebrates’ refers to all vertebrates except fishes. Vertebrates do not serve as an alternative determinant of hotspot status, nor do their endemics have to comprise 0.5% of global totals. If an area qualifies by the 0.5% plants criterion (and the habitat threat criterion), it makes the list. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 854) 

Plant endemic is the main criteria for belonging to the list.

> “The analysis omits invertebrates, which are largely undocumented but probably make up at least 95% o f all species, the bulk of them insects. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 854) 


> “A second determinant of hotspot status, applied only after an area has met the ‘plants’ criterion, is the degree o f threat through habitat loss. To qualify, a hotspot should have lost 70% or more o f its primary vegetation, this being the form of habitat that usually contains the m ost species, especially endemics. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 855) 


> “This overall approach, uneven as it is, is justified for an analysis that seeks to convert a profound problem into a fine opportunity. After all, to decide that a potential hotspot should not be evaluated because it lacks a conventional degree o f accurate data is effectively to decide that its conservation needs cannot be evaluated either, in which case its cause tends to go by default. Uncertainty can cut both ways. ” (Myers et al., 2000, p. 855) 


> “Since the original hotspots strategy began to be implemented in 1989, some $400 million has been invested by the MacArthur Foundation, the W. Alton Jones Foundation, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund and other non-governmental organizations.” (Myers et al., 2000) 

[[there are several private foundations that invest in conservation projects]] Need to look into this: #environmentalhistory #conservationbiology 


> “The traditional scattergun approach o f much conservation activity, seeking to be many things to many threatened species, needs to be complemented by a ‘silver bullet’ strategy in the form of hotspots with their emphasis on cost-effective measures. ” (Myers et al., 2000) 

The aim of the hotspot strategy
> “We could go far towards safeguarding the hotspots and thus a large proportion of all species at risk for an average of $20 million per hotspot per year over the next five years, or $500 million annually. Although this is 12.5 times the annual average o f the $400 million spent on hotspots over the past decade.
> The $500 million annually is to be compared, moreover, with a recent estimate47 for a comprehensive conservation programme to protect biodiversity world-wide costing $300 billion annually— a total that should, in turn, be compared with subsidies o f various sorts that degrade environments and economies alike, am ounting to $1.5 trillion annually world-wide48. ” (Myers et al., 2000) 

Finally, addressing (seems) the unconfortable truth of conservation projects: industrialisation itself.
