_27 January 2021_, Reading Conix’s 2019 ‘In Defence of Taxonomic Governance’

This is the paper where Conix coins the term #taxonomicdisorder as the state in which there are competing categorizations of organisms into species, different conceptualization of the species category, and different data, types, and methods of analysis.

Apparently, there is a converging consensus that “species are independently evolving lineages,” although I am not sure what this exactly means: does this mean that that which makes them a species changes? ([de Queiroz 2007](de%20Queiroz%202007.md) paper seems to discuss this). Seems like it: “Thus, the species category is not homogeneous, but is instead made up of different kinds of groups evolving independently in different ways and to different degrees.”
