**General remark**: 

A good question for the students could be:  

Despite a defence of exploratory science, does the article imply a specific hierarchy between exploratory and hypothesis-driven science? 

Because it seems it does imply that eventually you would need a hypothesis to make a discovery or proof a point. Also, in a related note, the way they argue for the existence of a difference between the two groups is by posing a hypothesis and then testing it with statistics, an irony also mentioned in [[2021-Felin et al]].

## Reading notes

> Night science has its own liability though, generating many spurious relationships and false hypotheses. Fortunately, these are exposed by the light of day science, emphasizing the complementarity of the two modes, where each overcomes the other’s shortcomings.

Night science and day science seem to allign somewhat with Kuhnian ideas about science: revolutionary vs normal.

> Essentially, night science is an attitude that encourages us to explore and speculate. We ask: What could be hiding here? How would we lure it out?

An interesting question to pose to the students would be: what do we need to be asking those questions? What sort of person would be better at asking interesting and relevant questions: a layman or a scientist with a lot of expertise? I.e., how does theory interact with our ability to seek patterns in data?

> To see the discovery in our gorilla experiment, all that was needed was some notion of primate appearances. But when you roam the limits of the scientific knowns, you need a deep understanding of a field to even recognize a pattern or to recognize it as surprising. Different scientists looking at a given dataset will do this against a backdrop of subtly different knowledge and expectations, potentially highlighting different patterns. Looking is not the same as seeing, after all, and this may be why some of us may stumble upon discoveries in data that others have already analyzed.

There we go, knowledge and deep understanding are always there!

> Day science tempers this liability. In a sense then, correlations are the domain of night science, while causation is solidified by day science. Day science is the adult in the room, rigorously testing hypotheses. But despite its power, the day science mode is not amenable to generating the ideas in the first place. Only the night science realm, with its lack of specific hypotheses that blind us in day science, allows us to think freely in an exploratory fashion.

> Many discoveries that we read about came out of projects that were originally devised as fishing expeditions or that turned into such after the original hypothesis had to be abandoned. But we rarely hear about this historical aspect, because a tale about a logically made hypothesis and then tested in rigorous day science makes for a much better story and because these are the kind of stories that editors and reviewers like to read.

Exploratory science happens, but is framed as hypothesis-driven.

> One thing we have learned from decades of exploratory data analysis: do not give up on a dataset. If it does not support your original hypothesis, it likely contains hints at alternative, possibly even more interesting phenomena. And if the data supports your original hypothesis, still keep exploring beyond. If the dataset has been designed and assembled well, there are likely additional discoveries to be made.

Their final recommendation.
