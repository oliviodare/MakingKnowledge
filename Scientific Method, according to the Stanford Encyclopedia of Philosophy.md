## Reading notes


> Among the activities often identified as characteristic of science are systematic observation and experimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formation and testing of hypotheses and theories. How these are carried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like these have been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity from non-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical form of scientific method or methods should be considered science (see also the entry on science and pseudo-science).

This is the main thing that students need to know: there is a variety of activities, methods, and practices in science; but that doesn't mean that the particular one of their discipline doesn't matter: it is the way by which we can tell between what is 'good science' from what isn't (science vs pseudoscience, replicable vs non-replicable, and all the other debates on research integrity). This tells us one important thing about the concept of 'scientific method': it's deeply embedded with ethics.  
  
Another thing that should be worth mentioning is that while I do want to stress how the particular method/way(s) of the student's discipline, that doesn't make it exempt from change --> social dimension of the 'scientific method'.

> Scientific method should be distinguished from the aims and products of science, such as knowledge, predictions, or control.

That's one of the basic ways of structuring science and knowing what we mean when we speak of 'method'

> Finally, method is distinct, to some degree, from the detailed and contextual practices through which methods are implemented. The latter might range over: specific laboratory techniques; mathematical formalisms or other specialized languages used in descriptions and reasoning; technological or other material means; ways of communicating and sharing results, whether with other scientists or with the public at large; or the conventions, habits, enforced customs, and institutional controls over how and what science is carried out.

That's important too: 'method' (in the philosophy of science) is an abstraction of the process of science, and shouldn't be confused with the actual scientific practices or methodologies (method ≠ methodology) . However, while this distinction may be important for philosophers of science (and the author readily admits that "their boundaries are fuzzy"), we may want to include them or discuss them when talking to scientists.

> The issue which has shaped debates over scientific method the most in the last half century is the question of how pluralist do we need to be about method?

This is the main issue that we face when talking about 'scientific method': from unificationists that are essentialists about what consititutes science, to nihilists as radical pluralists. There is a range in the pluralism, and the challenge will be to transmit this pluralism to the students.

> Some middle degree of pluralism regarding the methods embodied in scientific practice seems appropriate. But the details of scientific practice vary with time and place, from institution to institution, across scientists and their subjects of investigation. How significant are the variations for understanding science and its success? How much can method be abstracted from practice?


> The choice of scope for the present entry is more optimistic, taking a cue from the recent movement in philosophy of science toward a greater attention to practice: to what scientists actually do. This “turn to practice” can be seen as the latest form of studies of methods in science, insofar as it represents an attempt at understanding scientific activity, but through accounts that are neither meant to be universal and unified, nor singular and narrowly descriptive. To some extent, different scientists at different times and places can be said to be using the same method even though, in practice, the details are different.

Optimistic philosophy of science: attention to practice. The last phrase is also useful and shows what sort of optimism it refers to.

> Section 3 turns to 20th century debates on scientific method. In the second half of the 20th century the epistemic privilege of science faced several challenges and many philosophers of science abandoned the reconstruction of the logic of scientific method. Views changed significantly regarding which functions of science ought to be captured and why. For some, the success of science was better identified with social or cultural features. Historical and sociological turns in the philosophy of science were made, with a demand that greater attention be paid to the non-epistemic aspects of science, such as sociological, institutional, material, and political factors. Even outside of those movements there was an increased specialization in the philosophy of science, with more and more focus on specific fields within science. The combined upshot was very few philosophers arguing any longer for a grand unified methodology of science.

Short review of the history of the philosophy of science in the 20th century, and why thinking of 'THE' scientific method is a very old-school idea.

> As these sections illustrate, the question of method is still central to the discourse about science. Scientific method remains a topic for education, for science policy, and for scientists. It arises in the public domain where the demarcation or status of science is at issue.

The question of method is a question of demarcation!

> Aristotle is recognized as giving the earliest systematic treatise on the nature of scientific inquiry in the western tradition, one which embraced observation and reasoning about the natural world. In the Prior and Posterior Analytics, Aristotle reflects first on the aims and then the methods of inquiry into nature. A number of features can be found which are still considered by most to be essential to science.

This is only if we allow a ahistorical concept of 'science', being treated here synonymously with 'inquiry into nature'.

> For Aristotle, science (epistêmê) is a body of properly arranged knowledge or learning—the empirical facts, but also their ordering and display are of crucial importance.

Not only observation, but how we order and display (the method we follow) those observations is key to good science.

> In addition to careful observation, then, scientific method requires a logic as a system of reasoning for properly arranging, but also inferring beyond, what is known by observation. Methods of reasoning may include induction, prediction, or analogy, among others. Aristotle’s system (along with his catalogue of fallacious reasoning) was collected under the title the Organon.

There are many 'methods' of organizing observations, ...

> In Aristotle’s Organon reasoning is divided primarily into two forms, a rough division which persists into modern times. The division, known most commonly today as deductive versus inductive method, appears in other eras and methodologies as analysis/synthesis, non-ampliative/ampliative, or even confirmation/verification. The basic idea is there are two “directions” to proceed in our methods of inquiry: one away from what is observed, to the more fundamental, general, and encompassing principles; the other, from the fundamental and general to instances or implications of principles.

 ... and the main division that Aristotle establishes (deductive: from observation to fundamental vs inductive: from fundamental to examples) is still present today. Or in other words ...

> In analysis, a phenomena was examined to discover its basic explanatory principles; in synthesis, explanations of a phenomena were constructed from first principles

> During the Scientific Revolution these various strands of argument, experiment, and reason were forged into a dominant epistemic authority. The 16th–18th centuries were a period of not only dramatic advance in knowledge about the operation of the natural world—advances in mechanical, medical, biological, political, economic explanations—but also of self-awareness of the revolutionary changes taking place, and intense reflection on the source and legitimation of the method by which the advances were made. The struggle to establish the new authority included methodological moves. The Book of Nature, according to the metaphor of Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) or Francis Bacon (1561–1626), was written in the language of mathematics, of geometry and number. This motivated an emphasis on mathematical description and mechanical explanation as important aspects of scientific method.

A history of what was about to change: modulations of the Aristotelian method for inquiry: emphasis on organising observations by a "mathematical description" and "mechanical explanations".

> In Novum Organum (1620), Bacon was critical of the Aristotelian method for leaping from particulars to universals too quickly.

A big change from Aristotelian thought: emphasis on methodical and systemic observation, as well as for a distrust on the senses, and the importance of reaching reliable knowledge by social consensus of experts.

> Bacon aimed at the invention of new arts, principles, and directions. His method would be grounded in methodical collection of observations, coupled with correction of our senses.

> The community of scientists could then climb, by a careful, gradual and unbroken ascent, to reliable general claims.


> The study of Newton’s method has had two main thrusts: the implicit method of the experiments and reasoning presented in the Opticks, and the explicit methodological rules given as the Rules for Philosophising (the Regulae) in Book III of the Principia. [...] The argument for his System of the World (Principia, Book III) was based on phenomena, not reasoned first principles. This was viewed (mainly on the continent) as insufficient for proper natural philosophy. The Regulae counter this objection, re-defining the aims of natural philosophy by re-defining the method natural philosophers should follow.

Another change in what is emphasized about the scientific method --> with Newton, an emphasis on phenomena, not on first principles.

> The scientist was not to invent systems but infer explanations from observations, as Bacon had advocated.

A shift in the priorities of what made good science good: towards inductivism. 

> This would come to be known as inductivism. [...] The emphasis was often the same, as much on the character of the scientist as on their process, a character which is still commonly assumed. The scientist is humble in the face of nature, not beholden to dogma, obeys only his eyes, and follows the truth wherever it leads.

Method and Personal Character as convex and concav (*à la* Daston & Galison).

> Clarifying fundamental ideas would therefore be an essential part of scientific method and scientific progress.


> Mill, in his critique of Whewell, and others who have cast Whewell as a fore-runner of the hypothetico-deductivist view, seem to have under-estimated the importance of this discovery phase in Whewell’s understanding of method. [...] Mill, in his System of Logic, put forward a narrower view of induction as the essence of scientific method. For Mill, induction is the search first for regularities among events. Among those regularities, some will continue to hold for further observations, eventually gaining the status of laws. [...] Mill put forward specific methods for identifying causes—now commonly known as Mill’s methods.

These may be important and be related to the book [*The Scientific Method: An Evolution of Thinking from Darwin to Dewey*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976191) and the five rules of Dewey.

> Positivism also had to contend with the recognition that a purely inductivist approach, along the lines of Bacon-Newton-Mill, was untenable. There was no pure observation, for starters. All observation was theory laden. Theory is required to make any observation, therefore not all theory can be derived from observation alone. (See the entry on theory and observation in science.)

One of the big problems of positivist and the inductive approach is the main philosophical critical of the existence of the scientific method: the imposibility of separating observation from theory.

> Recent attempts at explaining how observations can serve to confirm a scientific theory are discussed in section 4 below.

Now the theory-observation dilemma (that puts pressure on the inductivist approach to scientific knowledge) is framed statistically, and is attempted to be solved by using the appropiate statistical method.

> The history of science reveals, according to Kuhn, that scientific development occurs in alternating phases. During normal science, the members of the scientific community adhere to the paradigm in place. Their commitment to the paradigm means a commitment to the puzzles to be solved and the acceptable ways of solving them. Confidence in the paradigm remains so long as steady progress is made in solving the shared puzzles. Method in this normal phase operates within a disciplinary matrix (Kuhn’s later concept of a paradigm) which includes standards for problem solving, and defines the range of problems to which the method should be applied.

I do sympathise with this, specially the aspect that highlights how 'method***s***' should be thought in plural, and depends on the historical and social circumstances (the paradigm).

> An important part of a disciplinary matrix is the set of values which provide the norms and aims for scientific method. The main values that Kuhn identifies are prediction, problem solving, simplicity, consistency, and plausibility. [...] Once accumulation of these anomalies has reached some critical mass, it can trigger a communal shift to a new paradigm and a new phase of normal science. Importantly, the values that provide the norms and aims for scientific method may have transformed in the meantime. Method may therefore be relative to discipline, time or place.

This is key: Kuhn's ideas seem very relativistic, it invites us to think that the indivudal scientist depends and cannot change the larger shifts (being stuck in normal science or producing a paradigm shift).

> Feyerabend also identified the aims of science as progress, but argued that any methodological prescription would only stifle that progress (Feyerabend 1988). His arguments are grounded in re-examining accepted “myths” about the history of science. Heroes of science, like Galileo, are shown to be just as reliant on rhetoric and persuasion as they are on reason and demonstration. Others, like Aristotle, are shown to be far more reasonable and far-reaching in their outlooks then they are given credit for. As a consequence, the only rule that could provide what he took to be sufficient freedom was the vacuous “anything goes”. More generally, even the methodological restriction that science is the best way to pursue knowledge, and to increase knowledge, is too restrictive. Feyerabend suggested instead that science might, in fact, be a threat to a free society, because it and its myth had become so dominant (Feyerabend 1978).

Then there is Feyerabend, that here is portrayed as having a similar argument as that of Kuhn: historical relativism. While Kuhn emphasizes the internal developments of the disciplines as the driver of changes in the scientific method, Feyerabend argues that there are a lot of extra-scientific elements (rhetoric, persuasion) as driving pluralism.

> A late, and largely unexpected, criticism of scientific method came from within science itself. Beginning in the early 2000s, a number of scientists attempting to replicate the results of published experiments could not do so. There may be close conceptual connection between reproducibility and method. For example, if reproducibility means that the same scientific methods ought to produce the same result, and all scientific results ought to be reproducible, then whatever it takes to reproduce a scientific result ought to be called scientific method. Space limits us to the observation that, insofar as reproducibility is a desired outcome of proper scientific method, it is not strictly a part of scientific method. (See the entry on reproducibility of scientific results.)

A small paragraph on the relationship between reproducibility and the question of method. Now the scientific method is framed as that which can produce reproducible results. This is because the emphasis on what makes science science is now its reproducibility, therefore the method that allows science to be reproducible is the scientific method.

> **4. Statistical methods for hypothesis testing**

This section goes too deep into the statistics for me, but it may be useful to show to the one teaching the statistics part of the seminar.

> **6. Discourse on scientific method**

This is an important section.

> Often, ‘the scientific method’ is presented in textbooks and educational web pages as a fixed four or five step procedure starting from observations and description of a phenomenon and progressing over formulation of a hypothesis which explains the phenomenon, designing and conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, analyzing the results, and ending with drawing a conclusion.

The naive version of 'the scientific method':  
1. formulation of hypothesis  
2. designing experiments  
3. test the hypothesis: conducting experiments  
4. analysing the results  
5. drawing a conclusion

> Although occasionally phrased with reference to the H-D method, important historical roots of the legend in science education of a single, universal scientific method are the American philosopher and psychologist Dewey’s account of inquiry in How We Think (1910) and the British mathematician Karl Pearson’s account of science in Grammar of Science (1892). On Dewey’s account, inquiry is divided into the five steps of (i) a felt difficulty, (ii) its location and definition, (iii) suggestion of a possible solution, (iv) development by reasoning of the bearing of the suggestions, (v) further observation and experiment leading to its acceptance or rejection. (Dewey 1910: 72)


The five steps, which tend to get associated with:  
- the H-D method  
- Dewe's account of inquiry

> Interview studies with scientists on their conception of method shows that scientists often find it hard to figure out whether available evidence confirms their hypothesis, and that there are no direct translations between general ideas about method and specific strategies to guide how research is conducted (Schickore & Hangel 2019, Hangel & Schickore 2017)

Two (more) issues with the concept of 'the scientific method':  

- asserting that data confirms or disproves the hypothesis is not straight-forward (according to a falsificationist view of science, you can't, and according to the H-D, you can only get 'supporting' evidence).  
- whether 'the scientific method' is an appropiate logical abstraction of scientific practice, it does not help much in guiding actual research.

> A frequently seen argument is that research based on the H-D method is superior to research based on induction from observations because in deductive inferences the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. (See, e.g., Parascandola 1998 for an analysis of how this argument has been made to downgrade epidemiology compared to the laboratory sciences.)

H-D (and specially being able to test) can be highlighted as a necessary element of 'the scientific method', and thus establish a hierarchy of the sciences.

> Similarly, based on an examination of the practices of major funding institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Biomedical Sciences Research Practices (BBSRC) in the UK, O’Malley et al. (2009) have argued that funding agencies seem to have a tendency to adhere to the view that the primary activity of science is to test hypotheses, while descriptive and exploratory research is seen as merely preparatory activities that are valuable only insofar as they fuel hypothesis-driven research.

With the political consequence it has.

> In some areas of science, scholarly publications are structured in a way that may convey the impression of a neat and linear process of inquiry from stating a question, devising the methods by which to answer it, collecting the data, to drawing a conclusion from the analysis of data. For example, the codified format of publications in most biomedical journals known as the IMRAD format (Introduction, Method, Results, Analysis, Discussion) is explicitly described by the journal editors as “not an arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery” (see the so-called “Vancouver Recommendations”, ICMJE 2013: 11). However, scientific publications do not in general reflect the process by which the reported scientific results were produced. For example, under the provocative title “Is the scientific paper a fraud?”, Medawar argued that scientific papers generally misrepresent how the results have been produced (Medawar 1963/1996). Similar views have been advanced by philosophers, historians and sociologists of science (Gilbert 1976; Holmes 1987; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Schickore 2008; Suppe 1998) who have argued that scientists’ experimental practices are messy and often do not follow any recognizable pattern.

Another element: the format of publication (IMRAD) further solidifies the idea that 'the scientific method' exists, but it does not reflect actual scientific practice.

> Hoyningen-Huene (2008, 2013), who argues from the history of philosophy of science that after three lengthy phases of characterizing science by its method, we are now in a phase where the belief in the existence of a positive scientific method has eroded and what has been left to characterize science is only its fallibility. First was a phase from Plato and Aristotle up until the 17th century where the specificity of scientific knowledge was seen in its absolute certainty established by proof from evident axioms; next was a phase up to the mid-19th century in which the means to establish the certainty of scientific knowledge had been generalized to include inductive procedures as well. In the third phase, which lasted until the last decades of the 20th century, it was recognized that empirical knowledge was fallible, but it was still granted a special status due to its distinctive mode of production. But now in the fourth phase, according to Hoyningen-Huene, historical and philosophical studies have shown how “scientific methods with the characteristics as posited in the second and third phase do not exist” (2008: 168) and there is no longer any consensus among philosophers and historians of science about the nature of science.

The four phases of the characterisation of science:  
  
- Aristotle to 17th century: axiomatic  
- 17th to mid-19th century: axiomatic (less) + induction  
- mid-19th century to end 20th: empirical knowledge as fallible yet making science special  
- Now: no consensus on the essence/nature of science

> For Hoyningen-Huene, this is too negative a stance, and he therefore urges the question about the nature of science anew. His own answer to this question is that “scientific knowledge differs from other kinds of knowledge, especially everyday knowledge, primarily by being more systematic” (HoyningenHuene 2013: 14). Systematicity can have several different dimensions: among them are more systematic descriptions, explanations, predictions, defense of knowledge claims, epistemic connectedness, ideal of completeness, knowledge generation, representation of knowledge and critical discourse.

'Systematicity' as the new defining feature of science. But what is 'systematicity'? It may hint at the aim of science of trying to make sense of complexity by giving explanations which connect different levels of nature (emergence, epistemic connectedness).

> Hence, what characterizes science is the greater care in excluding possible alternative explanations, the more detailed elaboration with respect to data on which predictions are based, the greater care in detecting and eliminating sources of error, the more articulate connections to other pieces of knowledge, etc. On this position, what characterizes science is not that the methods employed are unique to science, but that the methods are more carefully employed.

There are different elements that make science systematic: care, detail, articulation, etc.  
    
A recommendation from this to students could follow:  
  
- learn what are the elements of your discipline that are treated as gold standards, and inquiry why they are so. (I don't like this so much, but I think there is the potential for something here)  
- ...
