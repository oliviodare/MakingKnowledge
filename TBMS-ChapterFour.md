## Highlights and notes

> “This chapter and its position serves two clear purposes: first, it is an statement of my analytic position towards images and their relation to the text; ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 161)


> “This is an attempt to selfreflect, and if all fails, let it simply be a methodological chapter. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 162)


> “The few authors that take scientific advertisements as the central piece to be investigated are not within the field of history of science. They present their studies as assessments of the accuracy of the claims of adverts in respect to the standing scientific literature. This approach is common in studies which delve onto how pharmaceutical drugs are advertised in mass media, and some freely talk of “disconnect” between what is advertised and what is expressed in the expert literature.4 This approach characterises the scientific literature as a static slate of truths that can either be correctly or incorrectly reported in the non-expert media, and potentially mislead “vulnerable populations” such as anxious and depressed patients seeking pharmacological treatment. To my knowledge, even fewer studies have been devoted to study advertisement in technical literature itself. One of those instances, dealing again with truth statements in pharmacological advertisements, investigates how drug advertisements in medical journals are presented. The authors claim to assess the accuracy of ads by looking at whether they contained authoritative bibliographic information, and whether what was claimed was exaggerated, false, or accurately reporting scientific studies; and give advice to the medical population: “doctors should be cautious in assessment of advertisements that claim a drug has greater efficacy, safety, or convenience.”5 Their analysis is important, and I believe, invites to a more penetrating reflexivity than the previous one. By making explicit that highly trained doctors, and not only “vulnerable populations”, are susceptible of being misled by large fonts and impressive perspectival full-colour photographs, the authors highlight that the elite technoscientific class (including here also medical experts) is also a ‘public’, a “vulnerable population” in the eyes of commercial companies. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 162+1) 

This can be included but shorter.


> “As far as I know, only one study in the field of history of science uses advertisements in specialist literature for research objects as source material. And I would like to put an emphasis on my selection of the word, uses. Michael Fortun, in his chapter in Private Science, ‘The Human Genome Project and the Acceleration of Biotechnology’ tells a story about the rhetorics of ‘speed’ in the twentieth-century chase for Big Science. Fortun’s contribution is certainly welcome, as he argues that the need for speed was inherently “constitutive” of the Human Genome Project, and critically analyses the political dimension of quick-paced science, both as a demonstration of the competitive nature of contemporary Western science, and with an attention to how scientists experienced this new way of working, some of which were considerable concerned as they were “acutely aware of their precarious and ephemeral position between obsolescence and nonexistence.”6 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 163)


> “Opposite side to this quote, a full-page reproduction of the advertisement. Nothing else, no textual elaboration besides single-sentenced figure captions. It is fair to say that Fortun uses advertisements. I say that Fortun uses advertisements because their function in his chapter becomes simply a visual pointer for his narrative in the text. As if he was a tour guide, Fortun walks the reader down a busy marketplace as he comments on the movements of the local citizens among the grocers. To make the tour more entertaining, he points to the glass window shops, but doesn’t consider stopping. Fortun uses the same mechanisms as the marketing departments who first manufactured the adverts to arrest their readers and convince them of the truth of their statements. While BIO-RAD used the visual media to construct trust with the readers of the scientific magazine on the claims of the ad so that they would buy their product, Fortun employs the visual objects to construct trust with the humanists who read Private Science on the veracity of his narrative, relying on ads as unproblematic representations of the g eneral discourse on ‘speed’.9 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 164) 

This but kinder.

> “In their collection of essays Writing History in the Age of Biomedicine, we find reprints of several essays, two of which address these questions head-on, and which have helped me in coming to grips with the role of the visual in my own work. In ‘Coming into Focus. Posters, Power, and Visual Culture in the History of Medicine,’ Cooter and Stein deliver their account of a historiography of the visual in the discipline of historywhat they term in their subsequent essay as ‘politics of aesthetics’. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 164)


> “Cooter and Stein allude to two cultural strands forming this intellectual pot that has permeated academic historians, roughly falling into either Marxist or Foucauldian interpretations of history. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 165)


> “Of the first one, they pick Susan Sontag as scapegoat and intellectual mastermind of what they think to be an overly realistic interpretation of visual objects. Historians of public health such as Allan Brandt, they write, have been blindly following the interpretative path of Sontag. For both authors, they argue, “posters are simply footnotes to bolster a particular historical narrative, whether specific or general. Whereas for Brandt this is the narrative of public health, for Sontag it is the history of Western industrial capitalism.”10 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 165)


> “Cooter and Stein argue that due to the suspicions of the Marxists interpretation of history, a new way of looking surfaced, based on Michel Foucault’s work on what historical ‘discourses’ are made of and what they entail. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 165)


> “The historians don’t hide as laying closer to Foucault than to Marx, and are sympathetic for treating the visual world “as any other representation, functioning as so-called ‘truth regimes’ that produce and sustain systems of power.”13 Their final recommendation is vibrantly in tune with a Foucauldian understanding of representation, where visual images function, just as texts and institutions, as ‘regimes of truth’: ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 166)

An alternative would to the Marxist and Foucaudian analysis would be a conceptual history-like approach (social history and conceptual history): co-construction.


> “To reject interpretation is to reject the practice of finding ‘meaning’ as an ahistorical and unmediated ascription of ‘meaning’ to the content of art. Sontag rejects readings of art such as “What X is saying is ...,” or “What X is trying to say is ....”16 These phrases, to Sontag, encourage a decontextualised understanding of art. And what does it mean to bring the context in? What does it mean to abandon the project of finding hidden mysterious content (to see behind the “clouds of propaganda and illusion,” as paradoxically Cooter and Stein would say)? Sontag writes, “our task is not to find the maximum amount of content in a work of art, much less to squeeze more content out of the work than is already there. Our task is to cut back content so that we can see the thing at all.”17 The thing itself, she says, is the object itself and the function it plays in its contexts. To attend to the thing is to switch our attention outwards, towards the form. Moving outwards and taking ‘form’ as something beyond spatiality,18 we find the contexts that are needed “to see the thing at all” – its golden or metal frames, its neighbouring piece in the museum or an overlapping memo in an office notice board, its unique print or the multitude of reproductions – if we move outwards, we find the place where art has always been: the frame of history. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 167)


> “further specify what we mean by ‘form’ of images, ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 168)


> “Museums, like archives or any other “depositories for images and artifacts,” the historians argue, “have particular collecting agendas and particular institutional and intellectual traditions into which new acquisitions are fitted.”20 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 168)


> “Beyond the theme of their analysis, what I find remarkable, and I hope the reader has realised, Cooter and Stein focus their attention on titles, arrangement, and historical contexts. These are elements I have also tried to pay tribute in this thesis: titles of advertisements and their arrangement within the issue in the first chapter, and their argument in two historical contexts in Chapters Two and Three. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 169)


> “‘style’ of an object can be found if one attends to its repetitive patterns, what she calls the “rhythm”: ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 170)


> “Certainly, looking at advertisements as (1) historically situated objects, (2) with a sensorial quality, (3) and with certain ‘style’ to be analysed in terms of that which repeats; are the three characteristics of why, in all its banality, allows me to call scientific advertisements art. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 170)


> “Now, not all must be easy. And not all of these three dimensions (historical, sensorial, stylistic) are always accessible. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 170)


> “Taking Cooter and Stein’s approach, investigating the commercial effects or reception of the scientific advertisements was not my task here. Only marginally I addressed this topic when I talked about the dual nature of adverts as pieces of marketing but also as pieces that can be cut off from the magazine and used to place orders. However, I found no faithful ways of knowing whether scientists in fact used them as such. Strictly speaking, my thesis has not dealt with the success of the adverts in reaching and convincing people, nor on the alleged use of advertisements within the commercial relation between scientists and manufacturers. This would be an interesting (but arduous) line of investigation. In line also with Cooter and Stein, I did not set myself out to critique the advertisements themselves nor how Nature chose to arrange their display. This would certainly be a very revealing (but again, nearly impossible) research project, as knowing which advertisements were not published (if that was ever so) would give us some insights on the editorial, commercial, or political commitments of the journal.27 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 171)


> “Here, ‘the text’ are the negotiations of the scientific identity as appeared in the editorial pieces, what may be called ‘form’, ‘style’, or ‘historical context’. By attending not only the rhythmic elements in the advertisements themselves, but the repetitions also in the text as their most immediate framing, I characterise one of the forms of the advertisements to be the historical context that allowed for the advertisements to be printed and read in a particular way. Put bluntly, the advertisements do not illustrate or ‘represent’ the epistemic virtues of 1970s science per se. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 172)


> “What I tried to characterise was the epistemic virtues of the 1970s. My problem was: where to find them? Which sort of historical sources contain these analytic objects? Are they in people, objects, images, texts, or language? At the beginning of my research, I observed that the images of advertisements seemed to allude to some sort of relation between ways of knowing and ways of being a knower, but the specific way in which they related was still evasive. I did not want to fall into the trap of representation, nor writing things such as ‘this element of the advert represents this or that,’ because this is the sort of thing that Sontag says is ‘squeezing’ “more content out of the work than is already there.”29 This is much too realist and hermeneutic than what I wish to be. What I tried to argue in this chapter is that the epistemic virtues are not represented in the ads, but that within the adverts there are allusions to how the devices and objects are to be used and valued, and how researchers should use them within the context of the laboratory. Above all, what I want to say is that in order to understand advertisements as references with certain epistemic and moral acknowledgement –to understand them as such–, can only be done in the context of the magazine. It is the journal and the discussion of the texts that which produces the necessary context for these images to be understood as epistemic virtues. The ‘forms’ of the advertisements that repeats over and over are the words that nest the images and the golden frame of the magazine. The repeating rhythm is Nature. Just as museums have particular intellectual and political structures that guide the display of their pieces and the prearranged meanings by which they are to be understood, the printed journal provides a context in which scientific devices can be seen as the material goods which enable the scientist to reach the epistemic virtues as negotiated in the texts. It is this contextualized display which makes scientific advertisements intelligible, it is the aesthetic sensibility of their politics which makes them art. In between extracting too much meaning from an image and subordinating them to their form (the text), we must find a middle ground that allows for meanings to appear in our historical narrative, giving justice to the negotiations behind those meanings. In my case, the physical presence of advertisement in the magazine is the product of the epistemic virtues as negotiated in the editorial pieces. This is not to say, however, that the advertisements are not part of the discourse of what being a ‘good’ knower entails; but rather, that the relation between the image and the epistemic virtue is local and negotiable. The texts, which negotiate constantly in a flux what a virtuous scientist is, provide the frame for advertisements to become pieces of the imagined virtuous scientist. The images by themselves lack the meaning to be understood, and in my case, it is the editorials that provide the frame by which the images of the advertisements can be given local meanings— one of them being epistemic virtues. But in all these local textual negotiations of what counted as virtuous science, run profoundly the assumption that Western science is a virtuous activity on itself. Let us look at the virtuousness of 1970s more closely now. Who was the good molecular scientist? ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 172+1)
