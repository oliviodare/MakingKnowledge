**Take-home message**: This is a thin, broad, and introductory texto to "environtech", a historical approach combining (mostly) both insights from the history of technoloy and environmental history. The words that resonate are "scale", the "interconnectivity" of human and non-human systems, the politics of naming things as "environmental", "natural", or "technological". What the authors emphasize strongly is that the boundaries between technology and nature are not only unclear, but ***porous***, drawing an attention not just to how classification is problematic, but towards the causal  action between one and the ohter: it's not just "more complicated than that", but actually making an effort in describing how, when, and which parts of nature and technology exactly interact. 

There isn't much to say in terms of content, as this is far from what I will probably study. But there may be some historiographical insights that are worth noting.

This is the main teaching.<br>
