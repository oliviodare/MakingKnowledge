**Take-home message**: 
It draws a history of the notion of ‘endangerment’ as central to the project of preserving diversity, and focuses the attention not only on biological but also in cultural diversity.

They depart from the (generally held) claim that 'diversity' (both cultural and biological) is not a descriptive term, but one heavily embedded with values and politics. Their unique contribution is claiming that diversity is seens as valuable *because* it is at risk, and that its opposite force, endangerment, is "incorporated into its very definition."

## Reading notes
> Usually animated by a sense of urgency and citizenship, both among scientists and the general public, cataloguing an endangered entity involves evaluating the intensity of the impending threat and opens the way for preservation strategies. The resulting instruments function as mechanisms to produce knowledge, pursue ideals and enact policies.

[We could say that 'cataloguing' is the first step, the necessary condition under which preservation policies takes place.](making%20lists%20is%20a%20precondition%20and%20one%20of%20the%20initial%20steps%20of%20practices%20of%20conservation.md)

> [images, recordings, descriptions, or depictions of endangered entities (be them biological or cultural)] thus acquire significant political and moral valence inside and outside science. In the endangerment regime, turned as it is toward preservation, irreversible loss and definitive forgetting are ultimate forms of negativity, anti-values par excellence. [...] Which values, emotions and interests are entailed in the endangerment sensibility? How do they compare across fields and break down the barriers between “nature” and “culture”? What are their genealogies? And what are the particular “regimes” – in the Foucauldian sense of sets of power mechanisms and knowledge structures – that are associated with them?

This authors are interested in describing the 'endangerment regime', a set of "power mechanisms and knowledge structures" that allow for the collective perception of entities as 'endangered' and for the development of ways of dealing with such perils.  

> we are interested in the emergence and features of the perception that vast portions of the human and non-human world are in danger of extinction or destruction: how, and in which contexts and circumstances, did the adjective “endangered” come to be so widely applied – to biological and cultural entities, to species and peoples, to languages and buildings? *That* perception is widespread and recurrent, and the historical overtones of “sensibility” capture some of its central features: a certain sentimental impulse, empathy extending to animals, landscapes and marginalized humans, as well as attention to one’s own affective experience.

This book is about the historical emergence of the "endangerment sensibility", a certain collective perception of a wide array of entities in danger of destruction and extincition, and a certain preserving attitude to prevent this from happening.

A straight-forward definition of the '[[endangerment sensibility]]'.


> Most societies seem not to have known anything analogous until recent times (see for example the overviews in McNeill and Mauldin 2012). It is nevertheless a basic principle of environmental history that humans have always transformed the “natural communities” to which they belong and that inhabited spaces are to a large measure shaped by human action (see for example Hughes 2009). It should therefore come as no surprise that environmental reflexivity and awareness of anthropogenic impact did not arise suddenly around the mid-20th century. Such reflexivity, however, was not the same as a sensibility dominated by a concern for endangerment.

[The second part of the twentieth century is special and unique for the "reflexivity" and "sensibility" that arose among the scientific community and the general public](the%20second%20half%20of%20the%20twentieth%20century%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20collective%20environmental%20reflexivity%20and%20sensibility.md), however, this did not come out of the blue, and has a long history in the West. What follows is a short history of the endangerment sensibility, from Ancient Greece to the World War I.

> Paul Sarasin, the Swiss pioneer of world nature conservation in the years preceding World War I, called for threatened primitive populations to “be preserved as an ‘anthropological natural monument’ in the same way as endangered nonhuman forms of nature. They should be isolated in reserves and thus safeguarded ‘in the greatest untouched purity for science, for ourselves, and for posterity’” (Kupper 2014, 58). Nevertheless, *we*, *science* and *posterity* are different from *they*, *their forms of knowledge* and *their descendants* – none of which were contemplated. Most realized national parks fenced off their original inhabitants, thus becoming exclusively “natural.” Moreover, early interest in the fate of indigenous groups did not imply the will to perpetuate them as living cultures, nor manifested the sensibility captured by the late 20th-century term *biocultural diversity*. And even in this new framework, critics have contended that treating peoples (with their languages and cultural practices) as “endangered” maintains an analogy to nonhuman organisms and a top-down conservationist approach that may have racist and colonial overtones, occludes the causes of endangerment and deprives of agency the populations concerned (Gqola 2005).

The concept of 'biodiversity' as developed from the 1970s onwards effectively excludes the idea of 'culture' inhabiting the same spaces as 'nature'.

> In contrast to its synonym *variety*, *diversity* has ceased to be a descriptive term. It has become the name of a supreme late-modern value; and at the same time that diversity acquired the status of inherently endangered attribute, the concept’s extension grew to encompass both “nature” and “culture,” and came to be widely used to derive the value of both (see Maier 2012 for a critique of such uses).

['Diversity' isn't a descriptive term, but a "supreme late-modern value."](diversity%20isn't%20a%20descriptive%20term,%20but%20a%20"supreme%20late-modern%20value".md) What I understand by its relation to #latemodernity is that 'diversity' is embedded by a notion of culture not only separate, but endagering nature, and more globally, that late modernity is the homogenizing process that threatens both cultural and natural diversity.

## Continuation of the reading

> These developments are rooted in the rise of endangerment as a process constitutive of contemporary perceptions of the world. The Cold War played here a decisive role. NATO scientists and military officers anticipated “environmental warfare” and worked on various projects, dealing for example with radiological contamination, biological weapons and weather control, “that united scientific knowledge of the natural environment with the strategic goal of killing large numbers of people” (Hamblin 2013, 4). As “the environment” became a global issue after World War II, the prospect of human-made apocalypse nourished the style and worldview of the emerging environmentalist movement and its attention to large-scale anthropogenic changes.

The authors here argue that our current concern about anthropogenic changes to culture and nature, and our concern for the loss of biocultural diversity is "rooted in the rise of endangerment as a process" that [can be traced to the Cold War](the%20second%20half%20of%20the%20twentieth%20century%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20collective%20environmental%20reflexivity%20and%20sensibility.md).

> In short, those who planned how most efficiently to provoke a worldwide catastrophe fostered the sensibility that makes us see our planet as a constitutionally endangered place.


> The important point here is that diversity is seen as valuable through the lens of its being at risk, and that, in the final analysis, endangerment takes center stage because it affects diversity and has become implicitly incorporated into its very definition.

This is a central claim, and one that (maybe) relates to the late modernity and the notion of "risk".  

"Diversity" is good by virtue of being at risk, therefore it takes a dynamic definition, one that embodies two specific movements: one of modernity threatening its own existence by destroying the environment modern humans inhabit, and another movement of late modern knowledge practices as being able to assess then risk and pose solutions to the loss of diversity.

> What seems to be at stake, therefore, is less diversity as an intrinsically valuable feature of the world, than diversity as a practical condition of human survival. The widespread vocabulary of “natural capital,” “ecosystem services,” “sustainable management” and “biodiversity-based economies” attests to a range of pursuits aimed at balancing the exploitation and preservation of resources. And yet, when not the words, then the tone, style and moral passion of those engaged in protecting biocultural diversity convey the inherent value they attribute to it, and that they find materialized in the particular objects of their concern.

For the most part, the preservation of biodiversity arises from a "pragmatic and antrhopocentric [need]" yet is presented as a defence of biodiversity as something inherently valuable.

> the prevalent attitude has become increasingly pragmatic.

[[The has been a movement towards pragmatism in the history of environmentalism]].

> While earlier conservation sensibilities responded to perceived perils, they were sustained by visions of material and moral progress. The global preoccupation with biocultural diversity, in contrast, embodies a sensibility that is saturated with endangerment.

And I would hypothesize, it has a higher level of reflexibity, as it acknowledges further the anthropogenic role in causing and preventing the loss in diversity.
