**Take-home message**: In this auto-review, the authors outline the arguments of their 2007 book, *Defending biodiversity: environmental science and ethics*. What I find it worth is is 1: the expected miscommunication and cherry-picking between environmental scientists and environmental philosophers; but more importantly, the book may serve as a good framework of the arguments for the defence of biodiversity to analyse historically. The arguments are divided in two: instrumental and instrinsic, which seems to be a major axis in the debate. Instrumental arguments are ecosystem stability and functioning, provision of food, fibers and medicines (bioprospecting), and nature-based tourism. Intrinsic arguments (which are less clear to me) are: animal rights and environmentalism, land-ethic eco-holism, and aesthetic values.

## Reading Notes

> "Defending Biodiversity (Newman et al. 2017) can be regarded as something of a brush-clearing exercise and is therefore bound to upset those who are satisfied with the current landscape in environmental science and philosophy, muddy and overgrown in places as it might be." ([Linquist et al 2020:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=1))

How they define their work ([note on p.14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=1))

> "For example, environmental scientists routinely cite philosophers as having shown that species and ecosystems possess intrinsic moral value, apparently without realizing that this claim is deeply contested. Likewise, environmental philosophers often pick and choose among scientific theories that happen to suit their arguments without" ([Linquist et al 2020:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=1))

> "much sensitivity to the surrounding theoretical or methodological issues" ([Linquist et al 2020:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

> "By working through some of the more common points of contact, we sincerely hope to provide a stronger foundation for environmental science and philosophy." ([Linquist et al 2020:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

Book’s aim ([note on p.15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

> "We divide our examination of arguments for preserving biodiversity between those that appeal to the instrumental value of species and ecosystems (in Part One) and those that appeal to their purported instrinsic value (in Part Two)" ([Linquist et al 2020:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

Another axis of the debate: instrumental versus instrinsic ([note on p.15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

> "One of the issues over which they disagree is whether our current scientific understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning justifies the conservation of biodiversity. Our claim is that it does not. However, an opponent might respond that it is reasonable to adopt a precautionary stance toward this issue. Hence the next chapter in our book is a review of the precautionary principle" ([Linquist et al 2020:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

Summary of the debate between Odenbaugh and Newman in the volume ([note on p.15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

> "Another popular argument for conserving biodiversity appeals to new sources of food, fibres or medicines." ([Linquist et al 2020:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

instrumental argument ([note on p.15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=2))

> "Chapter Four focuses especially on this question as it pertains to bioprospecting and the popular suggestion that certain medicinal benefits might not be realized without larger investments in conservation" ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

notion of bioprospecting —> need to investigate ([note on p.16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "Pharmaceutical companies face no shortage of options for exploring new medicines" ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "bioprospecting industry" ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "Nature-based tourism and its role in transforming the public's values is another popular reason for conserving biodiversity" ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "This brings us to Part Two of Defending Biodiversity in which we consider various arguments for the intrinsic value of biodiversity" ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

So Part One on the instrumental, the different arguments are: ecosystem stability and functioning, provision of food, fibers and medicines (bioprospecting), nature-based tourism.  ([note on p.16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "Chapter 8 is a discussion of the relationship between sentientist concerns about animal welfare and animal rights, and environmentalism. It is widely thought that these two value systems are inherently opposed. To promote the welfare of individual sentient organisms seems to require making certain ecological sacrifices. Conversely, promoting biodiversity can sometimes require culling organisms—often sentient animals—who threaten it. This chapter argues that the opposition between these two doctrines is not as clear cut as it might appear" ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

Critique of the seeming opposition between animal rights and environmentalism ([note on p.16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "For instance, the conditions that promote animal welfare often align with environmentalists' objectives." ([Linquist et al 2020:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

Seems a pretty simple argument ([note on p.16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=3))

> "Whereas a strong defence can be given for the intrinsic moral value of sentient organisms, it is less obvious whether moral standing should be extended to such ecological wholes as species, regions, or entire ecosystems. Chapters 9 and 10 explore popular defenses of this "eco-holist" position, focusing in particular on the work of Aldo Leopold and some contemporary advocates of his famous Land Ethic." ([Linquist et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

May want to look into this ([note on p.17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

> "Western ethical frameworks evolved to recognize persons, not nature, as morally significant. This obstacle has motivated two procrustean strategies that seem intent on extending this framework indefinitely outward. One strategy involves the personification of ecological wholes, portraying species or ecosystems in an organismic guise to make it seem, if you squint hard enough, as if they possess something like an interest ... The alternative approach has been to 'de-personify' our ethical framework, which means abandoning human-centered values. (p. 412)." ([Linquist et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

INTERESTING! ([note on p.17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

> "The final argument we explore appeals to aesthetic values" ([Linquist et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

To review, intrinsic arguments for defending biodiversity are: animal rights and environmentalism, land-ethic eco-holism, and aesthetic values. [what are the different ideal type approaches to Nature in conservation biology and related fields?](what%20are%20the%20different%20ideal%20type%20approaches%20to%20Nature%20in%20conservation%20biology%20and%20related%20fields?.md).  ([note on p.17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

> "In a nutshell, our position on aesthetic value echoes the conclusion we arrive at for every other argument in our book: it provides a fairly strong defense of at least some species or regions, but is by no means a blanket defense for conserving biodiversity on the whole." ([Linquist et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

> "This is an outcome that some proponents of the environmentalist agenda might find uncomfortable: that none of the standard defenses provide support for the conservation of biodiversity per se." ([Linquist et al 2020:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))

Final, main argument. ([note on p.17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EIFLFANT?page=4))
