**Take-home message**: This is a cry for a move to a virtual academic world. Slightly dissapointing, as they don't question the material consequence of digital environments and for the most part recommend history non-specific advice on reducing academic footprint.

## Reading notes
> Firstly, there is the issue of travel to access archival sources, which in some cases can be addressed through either digitisation or remote capture by research assistants. The creation and maintenance of digital archives has a carbon cost but this is almost certainly lower than the carbon cost of scholarly travel to visit archives; digitisation also has wider public access benefits

They provide no evidence for such 'certainty'.

> we can promote the creation and use of digitally-captured collections in order to minimise travel

Perhaps the problem is not travelling, but travelling far away?

> We might also consider making ‘in person’ conferences biennial, holding virtual conferences in alternate years, with local nodes for people co-located in an area to come together in one venue to engage with the conference. Here it is worth noting that while research shows a close relationship between travel-related carbon emissions and academic salary level, there is no significant relationship between academic travel and research productivity.

The last link with productivity is more interesting, and it's a shame they don't develop more the relation between competition, salary, carbon footprint (or a more general, contribution to environmental decay).

> As another alternative or complement to the outward-looking academic conference, we could commit more resources to nurturing local scholarly networks. This need not entail completely reorienting current research agendas, but finding thematic or methodological resonance with nearby researchers, and encouraging the formation of less transient scholarly communities within and between proximate universities. We might also work with a more diverse range of institutions to encourage inclusive historical work that connects communities and their local places, as such work supports community resilience in challenging times.

This, I highly agree with, except the fact that I would stress the need of indeed "reorienting current research agendas", if not "completely", at least *largely*.

> Universities could implement measures which work to reduce carbon footprints from travel. These could include [...] extending funding to include carbon offsets in the case of justified/approved travel.

This is ridiculous. The market of carbon does nothing (good) to improve the carbon footprint of human society as a whole. Academia and universities shouldn't join the games that big corporations and governments play to greenwash their role in destroying the environment that we live in. 

> Additionally, universities could consider measures to more effectively provide alternatives to travel. Investment in **excellent internet connections** and digital conferencing capabilities with instantaneous IT support is essential, as is the provision of appropriate facilities allowing online meetings with minimal disturbances

Remembering that "excellent internet connections" means also more extensive material infrastructure, which has increasing environmental consequences. 

> Beyond academia, we are also citizens with the capacity to engage in collective action – as voters, consumers, unionists, investors, campaigners. These roles are fundamental to the function of our democracy and our economy, and allow for individuals to make a difference, however small, to achieving climate action and climate justice.

They dedicate a very small paragraph to "beyond academia". I could voice some of my critics through here.
