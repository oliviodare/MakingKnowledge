**Take-home message**: This paper hopes to understand the relation between prestige and open access, putting the emphasis on the role of commercial publishing houses in molding this relation to the point of having become indispensable partners in the research efforts as proxys of prestige. Argues for the difference (yet porous relation) between value-driven and profit-driven publishing. As well, it points to the historical continuities and discontinuities between the current tension between a non-commercial, older ethos of the gentelmanly-based scientific societies in which the current academic culture is still based on, and the commercial system for which they collaborate and do not benefit from (anymore) due to the decreased funding since 1970s yet the continuous growth of university research.

## Highlights and notes

> “We argue that current policy regarding open access publishing, and many of the other proposals for the reform of academic publishing, have been too focused on the opportunities and financial challenges of the most recent changes in digital communications technologies and have given undue weight to commercial concerns ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 2)

Great! Bringing the attention to the commercial aspect in OA.

> “The key themes of this briefing paper are: 
> > • the business of academic publishing 
> > • the role of publishing in academic careers 
> > • and the tangled and changing relationship between them ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 2)

> “However, until relatively recently, research publications were rarely financially profitable for authors or for the learned societies that helped to disseminate new knowledge. Virtually all journal publishing and much book publishing depended on the generosity of sponsors ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 2)

> “In this paper we show how, during the early Cold War, academic publishing became a highly profitable industry ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 2)


> “The international expansion of research, coupled with growth of the university sector and relatively generous funding in the UK (and the USA), created a context in which academic publishing could be transformed from something needing support into a way of generating income ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 2)  

Nice way of phrasing it: the high funding created a (very specific) context which allowed for commercial enterprises to feed of.



It seems as thought this put scientist in a position in which if something went wrong, the most preferable way of protesting was to ask for more funding (mostly individually, but ocassionally politically-organised).


> “During the three decades following the Second World War, the expansionist strategies of commercial publishers served the expanding research community well But this mutuallybeneficial relationship became difficult to sustain in the 1980s, when UK universities entered a period of cuts and under-funding that made it impossible for them to keep their libraries stocked with all the latest academic books and journals ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 3)  

A relation of every-growth


> “Historically, the peer review processes on which academic reward and recognition depend had belonged to disciplinary communities, learned societies and university presses; but their adoption by commercial publishers in the 1960s and 1970s means that they are now sold as a key value-added service to the academic community T” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 3)  

I don't understand how commercials offer peer-review as a service.


> “Since the Second World War, academic publishing practices have had to cope with the increasing number of researchers and publications in the international research community, with the changing expectations placed on academics and the higher education sector in terms of workloads and outputs, and with new business models in the publishing industry ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 4)  

The rise of managerial science


> “Academic cultures of prestige are derived from the voluntary, gentlemanly practices of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars and their learned societies; as such, they sit somewhat uncomfortably with post-1945 developments The ethos of the academic research community had historically been noncommercial, and the sharing of knowledge had historically been enabled by the generosity of publishing organisations – such as learned societies and university presses – with a mission for scholarship rather than profit But since the end of the Second World War, academic publishing has become increasingly commercialised ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 4)  

Nice, very citable.


How historical continuities can general tensions.


> “From 1945 until the mid-1970s, the commercial model of academic publishing fitted well with the needs of an expanding academic research base that was increasingly international and increasingly specialised; and it was financed by sales to the libraries of the growing higher education sector in the UK and USA ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 4)  

If fitted well because academia was well-funded.


> “From the 1790s, increasing numbers of periodicals catered to a growing reading public in Britain Most learned societies ran scholarly periodicals, but there also emerged many independent periodicals, carrying everything from full research papers to snippets of scientific news (Fyfe, 2016) 

Print culture made it possible for people excluded from the societies by geography, gender, or class to participate – as readers, and possibly as authors – in some aspects of scholarly culture ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 5)  A *cheap* periodical culture was the context in which commercial publishing (not only of science) emerged.


> “The widespread concept of a university as a community of scholars, in which both students and staff engaged in critical enquiry, meant that professors were expected to engage in both teaching and research These professors participated in the voluntary scholarly cultures of the learned societies and periodicals, but also owed loyalty to the institutions that employed them Academic identity and culture were forged from the adaptation of disciplinary scholarly cultures to the context of professional employment in the universities ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 5)  

Universities in the nineteenth century


> “Until very recently, publishing and distributing research necessarily required the services and skills of printers, publishers and booksellers However, for most scholars and many of their publishers, scholarly publication was routinely seen as unprofitable: the potential market was so small and uncertain that few scholarly publications were expected to cover their costs Those costs – of paper, ink, typesetting, and printing – were often paid in full or in part by authors or by a third-party, such as a patron or sponsor; and this enabled the copies to be sold at a subsidised price, or even distributed gratis” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 5)  

Pre-1940s printed publishing was expensive and non-profitable: balanced between low-funding contexts and high-expenses publishing mantained commercial enterprises at bay.


> “Some book publishers certainly did judge their market correctly; but few journal publishers before 1900 managed to do better than break-even ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 6)


> “From the 1830s, it was argued that authorship would be a better way of evaluating intellectual merit (Babbage, 1830) The scientific learned societies increasingly cared more about demonstrable scholarly activity than family background” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 6)  

Moving from gentelmanly prestige towards *published* academic regonition


> “Yet, while it is undoubtedly true that universities appreciated research prowess in their academic staff, the idea of the university remained the Humboldtian ideal of a community of scholars engaged in both teaching and research (Anderson, 2010) Prior to the 1940s, in most of the oldest universities in Europe, research did not dominate expectations of academic life ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 6)  

Another factor that adds to the above factors (low profitability of publishing, little unstructured funding) that kept commerciality away from science: more teaching than research.


> “This expansion of the UK higher education sector was part of a pattern seen across Europe and North America, driven by government desire to increase the proportion of students going to university ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 7)  

University growth post-WWII.


> “Since the 1970s, however, the on-going expansion of the higher education sector has been accompanied by worries about the rising costs, changes to funding arrangements, and growing government demands for accountability ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 7) 

Growth comes with more accountability


> “Many universities can now be seen as large enterprises, and increasingly behave as such, with university leaders adopting management techniques from other areas of business (Deem, Hillyard, & Reed, 2007) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 7)  

The university turns into management.


> “research prestige is now widely regarded as the dominant criterion for academic career progression (Morley, 2016; Coate & Kandiko Howson, 2016) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 7)  

The turn of the university from a teaching to a research institution.


> “The increasing output of academic publishing during the 1950s and 1960s coincided with the expansion of universities and the availability of generous funding for core functions such as libraries By the 1980s, the contraction of core university funding meant libraries were unable to keep up with the growth in academic publishing This became widely known as the ‘serials crisis’ (Douglas, 1990), although, as libraries diverted funds to journal budgets, it seemed to some more of a ‘monograph crisis’ (Thompson, 2005) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 8)


> “One of the most dramatic changes in academic publishing since 1945 has been the emergence of commercial firms that were able to become highly profitable This was due in part to the growth of academic research and the relatively generous funding available for the expanding university library sector: there was more research to be published, but also more institutions able to purchase it. But it was also due, critically, to the adoption of new publishing strategies associated with new players in the academic journal publishing market led by British and Dutch firms, most notably Pergamon Press and Elsevier These strategies were subsequently imitated by the older commercial firms, and would influence the practices of mission-oriented publishers The new players in the market developed a threefold strategy: 
> > “1. Rather than focusing on the publication of scientific news and short research reports, as nineteenthcentury commercial journals had done, they sought to be publishers of detailed primary research papers They set up dozens of new research journals, particularly in the many emerging sub-disciplines which did not yet have journals (or societies) of their own ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 9) 

 I don't really understand the shift --> but it does seem that they realised they could make more profit by dividing the fields and making more specialised journals.

> > “2. They focused on selling to institutions This contrasted both with the learned society tradition of giving copies of journals to many universities and libraries gratis, and with the model used by periodicals like Nature, which initially concentrated on sales to individuals The new players recognised that institutions could be charged more per subscription than individual readers ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 9)  

Important!
> > “3 And, most importantly, the new players focused on the international market They therefore had a vastly larger potential customer-base than the traditional nationally- (or linguistically-) based journals To do this, they published in English (helping to develop English as the new international language of research)” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 9)


> “From the 1950s to the 1970s, publishers of all types developed increasingly sophisticated sales and marketing strategies; and they also recognised that certain costs could be reduced by sharing them between multiple journals or book series ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 9)


> “Mission-driven publishing organisations, such as learned society publishers and university presses, were significantly affected by the emergence of a viable commercial model of academic publishing Adopting the new strategies meant that subsidising the publication of research could become a choice, rather than the necessity it once had been (Fyfe, 2015a) During the 1950s and 1960s, mission-driven publishers focused on the modest goal of trying to break-even, but by the 1990s, income-generation was increasingly seen as the goal, especially in journal divisions. These organisations have not abandoned their scholarly missions, but have sought ways to adopt commercial strategies alongside the mission The role of society publishing and university presses in relation to their parent institutions has been tacitly recast: rather than a direct service to scholarship, publishing has become a tool for generating income that can be put to good purpose (for instance, by funding conferences, travel grants or student bursaries) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 9)  

Very interesting! The commercialisation of learned societies and the reason behind travel grants and student bursaries!


Mission-driven can also be called value-based publishing.


> “But size matters: only a few learned societies and university presses have the capacity to compete effectively with those publishers that are part of international media conglomerates ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 10) 

 Important!


> “By 2004, about half of all societies published via a third party; both commercial publishers and university presses are involved in this (Baldwin, 2004) Co-publishing arrangements have given smaller societies access to expertise and services they cannot themselves provide, as well as a new income stream; but it also means that their pricing, sales and marketing strategies are usually driven by the imperatives of their publishing partner T” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 10)  

Event the small ones (e.g., Gewina, JHoK) can be made to be profitable.


> “There are now an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 journal publishers globally, but most issue only one or two journals Just four large commercial firms each publish more than 2,000 journals: Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, and Taylor & Francis (Ware & Mabe, 2015, p 45) Their profitability has become so reliable that they are regarded as sound investments (Morgan Stanley Equity Research, 2002; Aspesi & Luong, 2014) This ‘oligopoly’ of big commercial firms has most influence in the social sciences, where they publish 70% of articles globally In natural sciences, where certain learned societies (such as the American Chemical Society) remain significant players in the journal market, the top four commercial publishers account for around 50% of published papers In contrast, in the humanities, the continuing focus on fragmented, local and linguistically-bounded markets appears to have more limited appeal to the big multi-nationals (Larivière, Haustein, & Mongeon, 2015) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 10)  

The publishing oligarchy in the different sciences (social, natural, humanities)


> “concentration of ownership ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 10)


> “In the traditional, liberal idea of the university, research and teaching were part of a shared enterprise, and this was reflected by way that the ‘block grants’, awarded to each university by the University Grants Committee in the 1960s and 1970s, were intended to fund both research and teaching ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 10)  

University was a place of teaching and research.


> “At the same time, increased state intervention during the Thatcher years eroded the autonomy of the universities, and gave rise to demands for more accountability Teaching and research budgets were separated in 1985, and in 1989, the University Grants Committee, which had largely protected the universities from economic or social demands, was abolished ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 11)  

Separation of teaching and research in the 1980s.

> “This encouraged many pre-1992 universities to emphasise their research excellence so as to distinguish themselves from their competitors Although some newer universities have built reputations for teaching excellence, both formal and informal measures of institutional prestige continue to favour the older, research-intensive universities, thereby cementing the perceived relationship between prestige and research This trend has been substantially shaped by the increasing influence of international league tables, some of which rely largely on research standing and make little effort to evaluate teaching properly (Hazelkorn, 2015) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 11)    

Excellence as research-based.  


> “culture of research-based prestige ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 11)  


> “For the researchintensive universities, particularly in the post-1992 world, research has become their unique selling point and is central to their identity and mission ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 11)  


> “The term ‘peer review’ came to public prominence in debates over grant funding in the USA in the 1970s (Baldwin, 2017), and has since been extended to cover a variety of processes by which academics formally evaluate each other’s work ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 12)  

Origin of peer-review is funding allocation, NOT publication verification  


> “When new commercial players entered the academic journal publishing market in the post-war years, they sought to establish themselves as publishers of detailed papers of original research This was a role traditionally associated with the society publishers, who argued that their access to the expertise and voluntary labour needed for the refereeing of such papers made them uniquely fitted for the task But by the 1960s, the commercial publishers were able to colonise new sub-disciplines by adapting the societies’ editorial processes: they recruited academics to act as editors, editorial board members and referees Since this work had traditionally been part of the voluntary practices of the learned societies and university presses, and was seen by universities as a normal part of the duties of their academics, there was no perceived need to provide payment for this work Refereeing, or – as it increasingly became known ‘peer review’, became the way for publishers to legitimise their journals as venues for high-quality original research (Baldwin, 2015) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 12)  

Addressing somewhat a quesiton I had before.



Commercial publishers used the mode of the societies, and commercialised only part of it, without the aspect of paying referees.


You could argue (and [some do](https://medium.com/@jamesheathers/the-450-movement-1f86132a29bd)) that you should pay referees, but this would not be a good idea: more commercialisation of the whole process would only further add economic factors to the disemination of knowledge.  


> “The co-option of peer review by profit-oriented publishers now sits in tension with the perception of individual academics, who (despite complaints about the rising burden) remain largely committed to the traditional vision of refereeing and editorial work as a voluntary service to the wider academic, or disciplinary, community ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 12)  This is great! Very citable!

There is a tension between a non-commercial, older ethos (of the societies) and the commercial system for which they collaborate and do not benefit from.

However, they don't/can't do anything about it!  


> “For several decades, from the 1950s to the 1980s, the commercial model worked well for both publishers and academic researchers The eagerness of publishers to launch and expand journals, and to take on new book titles, meant that academics’ ability to publish their research was not constrained by the resources of learned societies or university presses Commercial publishers helped to establish new research fields and communities, and helped to internationalise and expand the circulation of academic publications ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 13)    

Important argument: commercial publishers *helped* to establish new research fields –they are an important player of the community.  


> “By the 1980s, this golden period was over The key contributing factors to its demise were: • The expanding research base: the number of new journals continued to grow, as did the number of books being published • The state of the economy: the late 1970s was a time of significant inflation The annualised UK inflation rate for the 1950s and 1960s had been 4%, but in the late 1970s, it was over 14% (Measuring Worth, 2016) Publishers’ costs rose Library budgets no longer stretched so far • University funding: in the 1980s, UK government funding for higher education did not keep pace with the ongoing expansion of the sector Universities experienced funding cuts, and library budgets were easy targets for cash-strapped institutions wishing to redistribute resources This was particularly true in those universities that did not do well at gaining additional research funding Library purchasing budgets either stagnated or were cut • Exchange rates: UK universities do not purchase only UK-published books and serials, so library purchasing power is affected by exchange rate fluctuations (Kidd, 2010) Since the late 1970s, the pound has been weaker against the US dollar (purchasing less than $1 80) than it was in the immediate postwar period (around $2 80) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 13)  


> “Academic publishing does not, however, function as a free market Unlike most commercial goods, academic journals and books are each unique and cannot be substituted by cheaper alternatives Thus, university libraries and their readers cannot choose between equivalent goods; and they have little or no bargaining power because publishers are under no competitive pressure from rivals with cheaper goods (McGuigan, 2004; McGuigan & Russell, 2008) For as long as there was money in library budgets, publishers had been relatively free to create new journals, expand existing ones or increase prices, secure in the knowledge that any university which wished its academics to have access to the latest research would continue its subscription ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 14)  Important!

Academic publishing is not neoliberal in the sense of free market capitalism: the uniqueness of scientific output difficults that.  


> “This turned out to be no brief crisis, but the new normality It is now clear that library funding has not – and cannot – keep pace with the continually-increasing numbers of journals and books needed to contain the new discoveries and observations of the global research community ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 14)    

The so-called 'serials crisis' was not a crisis, but the normal, expected condition of the economy of academic publishing ***based on*** a science based on discoveries and continuous innovation.  


> “Digital technologies are certainly not the first technological advance to affect the academic publishing world In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were many innovations in the machinery of paper-making, printing and typesetting; these reduced the cost, and increased the speed and scale of production New methods of transportation enhanced the pace and reach of global circulation But none of these earlier technological innovations changed the essential nature of academic publications as physical objects that academics could produce and circulate only with the assistance of experienced tradesmen or industries ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 14)  

The dependance on technology and technological innovation has been there before the digital and internet revolutions.  


> “From the 1950s, photographic methods of reproduction meant that students and researchers could make personal copies without the labour of transcribing, and libraries could create miniaturised preservation copies of certain materials (Gitelman, 2012) Combined with typewriters, these technologies made it possible for individuals or groups of academics to publish their own pamphlets, journals or short books But experiments with distributing academic publications as photocopies or microfilm had limited success, partly because of the lack of a wide-reaching distribution infrastructure; ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 14)  

Guerrilla technology: microfilms, typewritters, photo-copy

But it isn't all about the production: DISTRIBUTION is also very important!  


> “and partly because the moral ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 14)  


> “courage and commitment required to publish research outside the established prestige-generating channels proved too high a barrier for most academics ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 15)  

And moral obstacles.  


> “Online publishing enables research to be distributed globally, rapidly and cheaply, so long as the end-user has an Internet connection Editorial and typesetting costs remain; but the costs of paper, ink, binding, packing and shipping have been replaced by the cost of running a digital platform It offers cheaper marketing and promotional opportunities, and the marginal costs (the cost of producing an extra unit) diminish at scale virtually to zero ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 15)  

Easy way to understand marginal costs: the costs of producing an extra unit (like one more paper, word, page, etc).  


> “Online dissemination thus offers a way of controlling costs that was not accessible to scholarly publishers in the pre-war period, and its global reach is theoretically capable of fulfilling the grand ambitions for the circulation of knowledge held by pre-twentieth-century scholars ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 15)  

The internet revolution wasn't so much a revolution in the *production* of the written manuscripts, but a revolution in their *distribution*!  


> “Digital technologies at first appeared to offer hope of a resolution to the serials crisis There were strong non-profit interests behind the development of the Internet and the Web, and in the early 1990s, there were predictions of price cuts and widespread online access to academic research In some academic communities, new models for communicating research quickly, cheaply and internationally were developed on a non-profit basis, most notably the creation of an online pre-print server for the physics community (arXiv.org). ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 15)  

INTERNET: early hopes of non-profit  


> “But most of the successful early entrants into online academic publishing were the big commercial publishing firms They were large enough to absorb the technical costs involved, and many were part of media conglomerates that were already exploring digital opportunities in other fields For these firms, the Web was a new commercial opportunity Savings on production costs would help the already threatened profit-margins; and digital distribution opened up new ways of generating income, including: ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 15)  

- bundle deals
- selling individual articles
- metadata business (stats, citations, bibliography)
- paid text and data mining

> “the tension between the protection of copyright and the desire to circulate knowledge been recognised and re-negotiated through licensing agreements ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 16)  


> “The issues of affordability, circulation and access originally raised in the 1980s appear unresolvable without fundamental changes to the model of academic publishing ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 16)  

The internet did not solve the 'serial crisis' because 1) it was not a crisis, it was structural; and 2) the solutions that were proposed were technical, which did not only not help address it, but encouraged further the structural issue of profit.  


> “The UK government’s commitment to gold open access funded by Article Processing Charges (after the Finch Report, 2012) protects the commercial model without addressing the underlying tension between it and the goal of circulating knowledge widely It is notable that the Finch group’s official remit to develop a viable policy on open access was supplemented by the instruction not to damage the publishing industry in the UK (Curry, 2012) It is therefore unsurprising that the same few big publishers that dominate the subscriptions market also receive the greatest share of the money paid for APCs to support the UK’s policy (Lawson, Gray, & Mauri, 2016) ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 16)  

very important and very citable!


Tension between the ideal of science (circulating knowledge widely) and concrete social interest (protecting national industries).  


> “In addition, efforts to use the Web to create alternative, non-profit-driven models of academic publishing have been stymied by the inertia of the academic prestige culture For valid historical and cultural reasons, academic systems of reward and recognition privilege the established forms of academic publication This includes the emphasis on the peer review process as a sine qua non, as well as the name-recognition and prestige attached to papers in particular journals or books from particular presses In the online world as in the printed world, publishing research with a familiar journal or press brings more prestige to its author; publishing in a new online journal or repository – as in a typescript journal in the 1960s – may be seen as a career risk It would still take significant moral courage for a UK academic now to publish their work outside the traditional publishing structures, although there are variations between academic communities As long as prestige is associated with established journals and presses, most academic publishing will continue to be done under the auspices of the big publishers, despite the now well-established tension between commercial goals and effective systems of research communication ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 16)  

This is the main tension that Fyfe points at: between, on the one hand, prestige as a central mechanism of employment in science and the use of journal recognition as proxy's for prestige, which lead to the creation and maintenance of a publishing oligarchy; and on the other, the ideas of a non-profit, wide-circulation of knowledge kind of academia

> “We are not the first to wonder why academics continue to give their labour – as authors, referees and editors – to publishing firms that do not, in fact, circulate knowledge widely and affordably The answer lies in a lack of detailed understanding among academics of the historical and economic forces at play in academic publishing; and in the success with which big publishers have learned how to make themselves apparently indispensable to the academic prestige economy We hope this paper will help to address the former problem, and might at least stimulate debate about the latter ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 17)  

INDISPENSABILITY: COMMERCIAL PUBLISHING AS PARTNERS IN THE RESEARCH EFFORT.  


> “Reflections and Recommendations ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 18)  

Here we go  


> “We have suggested that existing moves by governments and other funders to increase accessibility by promoting open access publishing have so far been stymied both by the power of the traditional prestige culture among academics, and, financially, by the lack of determination to demand of publishers the competition and value for money that are routinely expected of researchers ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 18)  

Why OA is not enough.  


> “Clearly academics are not the only stakeholders here and do not bear sole responsibility for change The wider system of incentives in which they participate is also influenced by governments, funders, universities, learned societies and publishers We acknowledge the challenges faced by university presses and by learned or disciplinary societies that are also publishers Many of these mission-driven organisations generate significant income from publishing to support a range of scholarly activities (Eve, 2014b) Nevertheless, universities and learned societies are the key institutions that reward academics and should have an active role to play in creating a non-profit, online model for academic publishing that meets academic desires both to circulate and share knowledge widely and to gain prestige among peers They could do this by offering direct support for non-profit publishers (which deliver better value for money), or by harnessing emerging technologies to establish their own publishing venues (as several universities have recently done) Such efforts need to be coupled to moves – which will need to be coordinated internationally – to reassure researchers that their work will be judged on its own merits, rather than relying on brand recognition of journals or publishers ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 18)  

Okay, it doesn't negate the need for prestige, but using a handful of journals as proxys for prestige. It advocates for being judged on the work itself, but I still feel as thought proxys will always be needed  


> “To academics: We would ask scholars to consider the responsibilities that sit alongside academic freedom and to reflect on whether they might re-prioritise the duty to communicate rapidly and widely in the face of the reputational credit that is earned through publication Given the crucial role that academics play in peer review, we occupy a central and influential position ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 20)  

Pressure through peer-review.  

> > “• Those serving as editors of journals and book series, or on editorial boards, should reflect on the ownership and mission of the publishers they are working for, and consider whether they are helping to get the best value for their discipline by serving in these roles 
> > • In setting up new journals or book series, academics should seek to work with mission-driven, nonprofit-oriented publishers or online platforms • Senior research leaders should leverage their accumulated prestige to enable their more junior coworkers to balance rigour, speed and value for money in their publishing choices 
> > • Academics should not sign copyright transfer forms that would give ownership to a profit-oriented publisher if a licence to publish can be granted instead ” (Fyfe et al., 2017, p. 20)  

Very clear recommendations.
