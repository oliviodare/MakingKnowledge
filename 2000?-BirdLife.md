## Reading notes

> Invasive alien species are animals and plants that have been introduced into a natural habitat.

I would like to understand more what 'introduced' means here: does it mean intentionally/accidentally introduced or could it result from environmental that drive species to relocate?

> In the last 500 years, species like rats, cats and mice have driven more than 70 bird species to extinction. They remain one of the greatest threats to our natural world.

> **The Problem**
> Invasive species are plants, animals and diseases that enter a country - often accidentally on ships, in agricultural goods, in people’s airline luggage - and then spread. Once established, they cause extensive, on-going problems. Invasive weeds smother our forests and gardens and displace our important food crops and native plants. Predators eat our native wildlife. Insects and diseases damage our crops. Invasive species can also harm human health. 
> 
> **Invasive species are now known as one of the leading and most rapidly growing threats to food security, human and animal health, and biodiversity**. Invasive species are a main cause of animal extinctions at the global scale and a threat to our efforts to prepare for climate change. Invasive pests, weeds and diseases cost the global economy many hundreds of billions of dollars each year through their damage to agriculture, human health and ecosystems. Islands are especially vulnerable to invasive species and in the Pacific they are already causing great hardship to our families, our farmers, and our governments as well as devastation for our ecosystems.
> 
> Much is at risk. This is not just about feeding our people or protecting our environment. It is about our economies, our health, our growth and our future. Invasive species have the ability to undermine all our hard work and our dreams for our children’s futures

Invasive species are a big concern in the Pacific islands. They are presented as the biggest threat to both social and environmental needs.
