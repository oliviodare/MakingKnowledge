# I need to deal with the relation betweeen 'biodiversity' and 'sustainable development'
#conceptnote

The topic of 'sustainable development' is important and has a history too, and parallel to that of 'conservation' and 'biodiversity'. 

According to [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md):
> Around the time the term *biodiversity* made its appearance, another shibboleth, *sustainable development*, was also gaining clout. In graduate school, I earned an official minor in conservation and sustainable development. Contemplate this for a moment and you see another tension: how can we simultaneously conserve and develop? The growing needs of a growing population would seem to clash with the neeeds of those who want unsullied natural refugia. Thses forces classh in titanic battles over economic development, social justice, and long-term survival.<sup>1 [endnote referring to literature on the tension between 'development' and 'biodiversity']</sup>
