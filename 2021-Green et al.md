**Take-home message**: Optimistic outlook on what is like to teach philosophy of science to science students of several discipline. Resourcefull, in the sense of being explicit about the attitude that teachers can have in order to get students involved.

## Reading notes


> As our starting point, we take an analytical concept from science education called the “implied student” (Ulriksen, 2009). Similar to Iser’s (1984) concept of the “implied reader” in the context of literary theory, the implied student refers to the tacit assumptions about students to which both teachers and students try to align their activities. As an analytical tool, the implied student not only serves to expose presuppositions we have about students in structuring teaching, but also helps to show how “structure and mode of teaching are dependent on students being willing and able to comply with the structure.”

**Recommendation 1: what sort of student do I expect?**

> In particular, we cannot assume that science students will be interested in all the canonical themes of traditional philosophy of science courses, nor that they are familiar with the teaching format or expectations of such a course.

Recommendation 2: don't expect students to be interested in (all) the traditional themes in philosophy of science, and don't expect them to be familiar with the teaching format.

> Since content and form typically differ greatly from other courses in their curriculum, a lack of clarity about the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) can lead to frustration and reduced motivation. Attempts to address this problem can benefit from critically examining students’ expectations, those held personally by students and through their (implicit) expression in the study program.

Recommendation 3: ask students what they expect, in terms of content, learning goals, and format.

> An oft-stated aim of philosophy of science courses is to make science students better scientists, i.e., to make science students more critically reflective of their own scientific research practices (Boniolo & Campaner, 2020; Grüne-Yanoff, 2014; Price, 2012). We are supportive of this claim, which also motivates our own teaching.

Recommendation 4: State the aim of the course: e.g., making science students better scientists.

> Assuming that all science students want to become researchers may alienate those who are instead aiming to pursue careers in industry, policy, consulting, or teaching.

Recommendation 4b: being mindful of the diversity of career options after their science studies.

> While all of our courses contain some generic elements (such as responsible conduct in research and practice), we make an effort to design teaching around cases that emphasize the epistemological, ethical, and social aspects of the specific discipline, as well as the institutional history relevant to that discipline.

Recommendation 5: adapt teachings to the specific discipline by drawing on case-studies.

> Cases like this allow students to familiarize themselves with philosophical themes without leaving their disciplinary home ground, thus providing a safe environment for engaging with novel kinds of questions.

Recommendation 6: use case studies to allow students to remain in "their disciplinary home ground"

> Of higher relevance to the students is the ability to identify hidden assumptions in ethical argumentation, as well as the capacity to discuss the implications of various views. Bursten and Finkelstein suggest using what they call boundary cases to confront students with examples that promote cognitive conflict. The aim is to compel students to examine unexpected ramifications and unwelcome consequences of their own viewpoints. We believe that these competences can be trained while also reestablishing the lost connection to more abstract theoretical frameworks in ethics.

Recommendation 7: (specifically for ethics) use "boundary cases" that promote "cognitive conflict": their immediate viewpoints may have "unwelcome consequences", challenging them may help students see their own pressupositions. (For details on this approach, see Bursten and Finkelstein, 'Promoting Cognitive Conflict In Health Care Ethics: Moral Reasoning With Boundary Cases', http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2128/researchpractice2.pdf).

> The examples above illustrate the difference between what in science education is called deductive and inductive teaching strategies (Prince & Felder, 2006). While the traditional (deductive) approach starts with the history of the philosophical debate and primarily uses cases as illustrations, inductive teaching takes concrete cases or the students’ own practice as the starting point. Inductive strategies lend themselves naturally to active learning approaches. Active learning refers to a spectrum of student-centered approaches, ranging from very “open” approaches, where students formulate their own questions and design their own analysis, to teacher-structured activities involving a mixture of teacher instruction and group work.

Recommendation 8: adopt inductive (from cases to philosophy) teaching  
 and active learning (students formulate their own questions with or without the frame of the teacher).

> Case 2: Risk assessment and scientific uncertainty. To promote reflection on the societal role of science, several courses include exercises where students discuss how their field can inform risk assessment and political decision making. Biology students watch a video where different stakeholders discuss the results of a cohort study documenting a statistical association between prenatal exposure to a chemical preservative and reduced head circumference of male infants (Lassen et al., 2016). [...] These cases illustrate that waiting for conclusive scientific evidence is often not an option. Students must therefore evaluate different types of evidence (and uncertainty) against the “inductive risks” of assessments that may under- or overestimate potential harm. The cases also raise discussions on whether and how to inform the general public about potential harm and scientific uncertainty, which is challenging in societal contexts where mistrust in science is a pressing concern (see also El-Hani et al., 2020).

 Example case 1: how to deal with risk in the face of uncertainty (Unable to find actual video, though).

> Case 3: “Functional” in biochemistry, chemistry, nanoscience To address the learning goal of being able to “exhibit disciplinary self-understanding and view one’s discipline in relation to bordering disciplines”, students in a course for chemistry, biochemistry, and nanoscience discuss the notion of ‘functional’ from their respective backgrounds, engaging with both commonalities and differences. [...] We ask the students to reflect upon a well-known concept from their field, and to contrast it with a seemingly similar concept in a neighboring field – in this case the chemical concept of a functional group, the biochemical concept of molecular function, and function in “nanomachines” [...] The question “Can the concept of ketone as a functional group be reduced to quantum chemistry or physics?” is then discussed and used to introduce the more general question of how scientific disciplines interact, not only from a positivist perspective on theory reduction, but also integrating contemporary views of disciplines as systems of practice with a variety of interactions (Chang, 2015).

Example case 2: same word, different concepts and meanings, depending on discipline. This could be interesting to test between medical and science students.
