## Questions I need to address
### What is it that I want to say? What is my message? 

#### *Message 1: content*
1. **In general**, I want to tell the story of how commercial manufacturers for laboratory objects *inserted* themselves in the printed forum of the scientific community in the 1970s, and the role of advertisements (their languistic style, fomat, uses, content, prices, management) in this social *insertion*.
2.  **In specific**, this piece illustrates how university research is indebted to commercial enterprises, as well as describing how commercial enterprises define and mold 1) scientific attitudes and 2) the research process itself:
	1.  *Scientific attitutes and values*. I describre here how commercial companies attempted to insert themselves as an integral part of the academic community by reflecting the values that researchers sought.
	2.  *The research process*. I explain the historical relation between innovation and standarisation, and the role of commercial competition in framing and constructing this relation.
#### *Message 2: form*
1. In this paper, I present a (pseudo)novel way of thinking of an understudyied historical source: the 'scientific advertisement'. Particularly, I argue for the need to address 'scientific advertisements' historically: these visual images need to be understood via their political, cultural, and economic contexts, but yet, they cannot be used as unproblematic visual cues supporting a given argument.
3. Relevant historiographies:
	1. Understanding the immediate context of the advertisement (Sontag, Cooter)
	2. The notion of 'forum of the research community' (Baldwin, Csiszar)
	3. Book history (Topham)
	4. Catalogue 
	5. Intellectual Property
 
 ### Why is this important?
- There are no studies that deal with scientific advertisements as *central* objects of study and advertisements. My aim is to sketch some methodological and historiographical pointers for future historical and sociological research.
- Regarding the content, this paper is important because it addresses the phenomena of the commercialisation of laboratory research, and in specific, the commercialisation of the *research process* itself, rather than the commercialisation of the end-products of science. This paper contributes to the recent attention that historians of science have given to the increasing role of commercial companies in university science in the post-WWII scenario, and the effects of this process. In specific, this paper puts the emphasis on the commercialisation of the biomedical research process itself, and the material and commericla culture of the laboratory. In short, this paper argues that the commercialisation of the research process is an important historical phenomena on which processes such as standarisation, innovation, and replicability hing on. 
	

### What are the elements I want to discuss, and how do they relate to standing research?
- ~~Notion of porosity ([Pritchard and Zimring 2020](Pritchard%20and%20Zimring%202020.md): how commercial players placed themselves as partners in the resaerch effort, and the porous (not simply vague) relation between university science and commercial partners~~

- In my case, not only the obvious manufacturers were commercial, but the context itself (*Nature*), which ubiqutuously presented it as a neutral forum "*of* and *for* the scientific community" (praphrasing). Here tying with the notion of 'forum' in [Baldwin 2015](Baldwin%202015.md)
	- *Nature* as forum, identity of the community, but mediated by *Nature*'s editorial decisions. ``unclear about this, especially in terms of evidencial support from sources``
- Missing indexation of advertisements
	- indexation as mechanism of construction of the professionalisation and legitimasy of research (no index, no science). ``not sure whether this is relevant for the main argument; literature could maybe be found in 'Gaming the Metrics'``
	- the inescapable value-laden aspect (digital) archives: there is no ads on the _Nature_ digitalised archive: we need to go to then physical sources. ``not sure about whether this is relevant for the main argtument; literature on archives by Lorrain Daston (among others)``
- The relation between innovation and standarisation: commercial competition. ``I don't have (much) literature in mind: Cambrosio and Keating (Private Science)`` 
- Advertisements need to be understood via their contexts, but they cannot be used as unproblematic visual cues supporting an argument. (the historian needs to co-construct a narrative). ``Fortun (Private Science), Sontag, Cooter``  
- The need for an expansion of epistemic virtues into the topic of social legitimacy of reserach ``cultural historical epistemology (van Dongen & Paul) & politics of form (Csiszar)``
		
### For *who* is message?
Historians of Science, Historians of the Book/Journal, and only to a certain extent, to Historians of Modern Biology.
		
		
### What kind of interaction/feedback do I want from this communication?
*Feedback from BSHS/Dominic Berry*
  - Historians would be interested because in the article I point to one kind of source and explain what to do with it.
  - Potential motivation to write a 8000 word essay: [BSHS Singer Prize](https://www.bshs.org.uk/prizes/bshs-singer-prize)
  - Historiography relations that may be emphasized: 
	  - imagineries in HPS
	  - Intellectual Property / Catalogue / Book History
	  - Topham student who worked on Catalogue History: Jones (Kent)

*Strategy (recommendations by Bert)*
- I need to connect with the literature: history in itself is not enough.
- Leave no gaps in argumentation, no thing without sources.
- Less is more.


### Once those questions are addressed: what is the best platform to achieve these goals?
[BSHS Singer Prize](https://www.bshs.org.uk/prizes/bshs-singer-prize)

It needs to follow the [BJHS guide for authors](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-for-the-history-of-science/information/instructions-contributors):
- 8000 words


### Approach
- If I want to address the question of 'how did commercial manufactuerers placed themselves as partners in the resaerch effort' (and how did this come about), perhaps not only a synchronic analysis is important, but a diachronic: what changed before the advertisements of the 1970s? Was there a difference? 
	- This may be outdated
- It could be a 'source discovery' paper, where I highlight what advertisements are and what to do with them.
