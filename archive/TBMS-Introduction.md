## Highlights and notes

> About a third of every hundred-or-so-page issue of the magazine was not covered by experimental pieces. Bound together, the sections Review Articles, Articles, and Letters to the Editor (later called Letters to *Nature*) where scientists reported on their empirical findings, coexisted with lead editorials like the one above, and all sorts of columns and sections such as News and Views, Correspondence, Book reviews, Obituaries, Forthcoming events, Appointments Vacant, University News, Appointments, Announcements, International Meetings, British Diary, Reports and other Publications, Person to Person, and Newly on the Market, all indexed on a first-page table of contents.3 Some of these sections are still alive and well today and have been a central part of *Nature* since its inception in 1869 and throughout its history. The magazine was and isn’t only a place to present and read about the latest experimental findings, but a place to read and discuss the political sitting of science.” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 14) 

This should be included, but shorter; mirroring Baldwin's book.
> Only recently, historians have started to take these sections seriously, by investigating the debates that take place within them and by attending to the material histories behind the making of those cellulose pages. Melinda Baldwin published in 2015 *Making ‘Nature’: The History of a Scientific Journal*, where she delivered the history, not only of the journal, but of the scientific community that contributed to its pages. Because, as we shall see, it wasn’t only the staff which authored editorial columns, but also external contributors who did not only adopt a passive position as readers but actively selfreflected in their writings on their condition as scientists.” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 14) 


> Scientific journals, and *Nature* in particular, are not only a repository of scientific facts and experimental cookbooks. They contain a rich perspective on the social issues that trouble scientists, and as such are fertile sources for historians to understand how the scientific process is placed socially, politically, and economically. Quite literally, reports of scientific experiments were placed in a specific order – before, after, or in between opinion columns – and with a certain relation of typefaces, line spacing, and referencing style. Even now, when academic publishing has largely moved online, the structure of journal’s website matters. Baldwin’s work is an invaluable open door to begin dealing with the journal as a whole, in its temporal and physical dynamism.” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 15) 

This could be a good phrasing to refer to Baldwin's.


> However, something is still missing from my first probe into the structure and meta-content of the scientific journal *Nature*. In fact, it misses both from the voices of the historical actors themselves and from the analysis of historians of science who have investigated the material culture of scientific publishing. There is no mention in Baldwin’s *Making ‘Nature’* nor in the other monograph on the history of scientific periodicals, Alex Csiszar’s *The Scientific Journal. Authorship and the Politics of Knowledge in the Nineteenth Century.*” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 15) 

This is the main historiographical contribution. 


> In my enumeration of all the sections that one can find on the table of contents of each issue, and from the description of Nature on its website, we find no evidence of one specific element which, despite its hidden indexation, is ubiquitous throughout time, space, and format.” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 15) 

This aspect of missing indexation is also related to 1) indexation as a mechanism of construction professionalisation and legitimasy of research (no index, no science); and 2) the inescapable value-laden aspect (digital) archives: there is no ads on the *Nature* digitalised archive: we need to go to then physical sources. 


> Their content, placement, and production have been for the most part been ignored by historians and sociologists of science. Put bluntly, it seems as if those studying the process of science have been running their analytic browsers with AdBlock Plus. To my knowledge, no study (in history of science or else) has taken the step to investigate the uses and meanings of scientific advertisements as commercial objects targeting the scientific community.” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 15) 

Another way of phrasing the historiographical contribution. There is a footnote to chapter 4 and the few studies that do treat scientific advertisements. 


> As frivolous a topic as this may seem, I argue in this thesis that scientific advertisements deserve historical attention, and that their content and form are as interesting and fertile for analysis as the debates that take place in the lead editorials, News and Views or the Correspondence.” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 15) 

This is a key claim of my thesis: that the editorials and the advertisements are related, but I am unsure whether I should bring this. It's a weak argument. The most strong example would be: on the one side, the health and safety order of 1974 and the editorials dedicated to it; and on the other, the ad to comply to that order. 


> The largest font in the ad read: > We want to make you ‘C.L.A.S.S.’ conscious” (figure 1, left). Below it, the reader would find an explanation of the marketed deal. Those expecting a commercial advertisement for awareness of social inequality may have been disappointed. > C.L.A.S.S.” stood for > C urrent Literature Alternating Search Service”, and the full-page advert announced a service of scientific informational indexing that bi-monthly would deliver a > computer printout consisting of pertinent bibliographic information” on the areas of interest that the customer would request.8 Well done, marketing department, you caught our attention. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 16) 

I am not sure I want to go into a discussion of the marketing strategies. 


> You are a scientist in the mid-1970s. If socioeconomically themed jokes didn’t do it for you, perhaps heroes would call your attention. Wang Electronics knew perfectly well what sold best to a scientist, and that is — another scientist. And who better than Darwin to sell the Wang 2200? In this recurrent advertisement (figure 1, right), Darwin’s picture is placed in the top centre and occupies half of the one-page ad. Below, we read a mocking yet revealing comparison between biological creatures and technological objects: both are under enormous environmental pressure and are placed in situations > where obsolescence comes fast and costs dear.”9 Using evolutionary language, the 2200 was marketed as > adaptable and fit enough to survive changing needs and varying demands.” In an unashamedly ahistorical way, Wang’s ad closes effectively: > Darwin would have loved it.”” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 16) 

At best, something like this, but not as the main argument (remember: LESS IS MORE!) 


> What does Darwin selling a computer and a British mathematician talking about prostitutes have in common? While this may appear as a joke, this is the central question of my thesis, an exploratory question, if you will. I wondered while reading Nature while holding the heavy issues bound together and flipping through its pages– about what it was like to see advertisements for molecules and reactives – ligases and kinases, synthesases, purifiers and acids, mixers and cell counters, lenses, tumblers and storage cabinets, free catalogues and minus 80ºC freezers, all delivered to your lab door, fast, and importantly, all these objects standardised, ease to operate, and promising to make your life easier. But specially, what was it like for the scientist to see these commercial breaks, not in the context of ground-breaking experiments, but surrounded by political pieces describing, seeking and constructing a public image of the scientific class, news about a decrease in public funds for research and a zealous governmental gaze looking to assess the return on its investment, and a push from all sides for making your science ‘socially responsible’? ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 17) 

This is the main aim of my thesis and a difficult undertaking, I don't know whether I want to do this for my (definitely shorter) publication/communication. 


> First of all, I’d like to point out to a choice in my terminology. I have decided to use throughout this thesis the formulation ‘molecular scientist’, and not ‘molecular biologist’ as was (and is) normally referred to researchers who work with molecular objects. I have chosen this specific wording for two reasons: first, because molecular work since the 1950s was done not only by those trained in the life sciences, and included a great deal of chemists and physicists;10 and second, I chose this seemingly uncommon formulation to illustrate how ‘molecular scientists’ is my analytic term which introduces distance with the actor’s category of ‘molecular biologist’. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 17) 

This aspect of terminology may be also used, in combination with a justification for *my choice* in the kind of equipment/discipline (molecular biology). 


> Since the late 1960s, the tools necessary for the manipulation of molecular components, and especially those for the cutting, copying, and pasting of genes became increasingly available. The possibility to alter the genetic components of virtually any living organisms by the use of these molecular tools quickly translated into the commercial availability of standardised products like the ones I described above. The ability to engineer (almost) at will the genetic make-up of the scientists’ model organism by the creation of recombinant DNA molecules, with the objective to observe downstream cellular, physiological, and systemic effects intended to design therapeutic molecular targets, as well as being able to create a profitable biomedical industry around these tools made the 1970s a > recombinant gold rush.”11 Competition between laboratories around the globe, especially between those in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America, surfaced. Nature and Science became the places where competition was spelled out, both in the form of scientific articles and political pieces. These magazines became household names for molecular scientists that wanted to succeed during this decade. Cell, launched in 1974 as "A Journal of Exciting Biology” appeared in response to the increasing specialisation of these molecular fields and for the demand for extra space aside the well-wanted Nature and Science.12 Already in the 1980s, scientists looked back with nostalgia to the past decade, describing the molecular community of the 1970s as an > esoteric, high-spirited, driven fraternity that, by good fortune was coming into maturity.”13 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 17) 

This argument that held my choice for molecular biology equipment needs to be strengthened either historiographically (first, which were the molecular tools discovered prior to 1970s; and second, was there a growing commercialisation, and since when?) or empirically (can I extend my analysis to prior to the 1970s, 1950s, maybe to show the growth in commercialisation?) 


> II. Images and texts as illustrating epistemic virtues ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 19) 

I don't know if I want to bring epistemic virtues to the forefront, or even if I want to bring it at all. 


> The images of the advertisements seemed to say something about how experimentation was carried out, and what was the good way of doing so. At the very least, they seemed to say something about what a good machine was like. For the most part, this thesis has been an attempt of figuring out what advertisements mean, and what their relation to normative notions of science. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 19) 

In my publication, I don't know whether I want to make this claims. 


> In short, I have moved from a representationalist to a contextualised interpretation of advertisments: from saying that their content represents certain epistemic, moral, and social dimensions of science, to saying that in order to be read like that, a thick context is needed. I will elaborate on these issues (what images mean and how should historians understand them) in Chapter Four. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 19) 

This is important. 


> Given the lacuna of historical and philosophical studies of advertisements targeting scientists, I have termed this group of visual objects simply ‘scientific advertisements.’ ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 19) 


> Scientific advertisements stand at a relatively uninhabited yet fertile historiographical crossroads. In this section, I place myself within a rich theoretical and empirical background, which has inspired me to design ways by which to look at these visual objects. I draw mostly from two research programmes: from the work on the history of journals, and from that in historical virtue epistemology . These diverse approaches to the world of visual objects (‘visual’ understood here in a broad sense) allow me to, in all modesty, present my source material as fertile for the study of the relationship between media formats, scientific practice, the economies of research, and the politics of technology. I explore the ways by which historians of science can look at these objects. These ways of seeing ramify in a variety of research questions. At the centre of this gaze into scientific advertisements, I aim to answer: what are these objects, and what did they mean to the people holding them? ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 19) 

Unclear whether this will be the question and frame to address, specially unsure about bringing virtue epistemology into it. 


> The recent work in the history of journals and scientific publishing serve as backbone for the understanding of the media in which my sources lay. Within this nascent field that promises to bring some historical awareness to current discussions on the problematics of scientific communications, two works are key. I have already introduced Baldwin’s Making ‘Nature’, and of the second one I have only mentioned its name. Alex Csiszar’s The Scientific Journal is the first monograph on the history of the specialist scientific press. His contribution reveals the interlacing of the political and epistemic status of what came to be the epitome of scientific media.14 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 20) 

I shall add Aileen Fyfe also. 


> Csiszar’s book tells the story about how the worlds of academics and journal publishers were in fact, different worlds. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 20) 

Using [Fyfe et al 2017](Fyfe%20et%20al%202017.md), I could add to Csiszar's story how progressively (specially in the twentieth century), the academic community came to actually depend not only on journal publishers, but increasingly more on commercial journal publishers. 


> Then, Csiszar goes a step further by showing that while the distance between journals and academics was large, it was even more so between commercial publishers and the Royal Societies. He traces a similar movement during the century as with journal publishing per se, through which publishing science in a for-profit press or becoming a paid author became increasingly (not without tensions) a more recognised and respected way of transmitting about one’s scientific studies.16 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 20) 

While Csiszar is useful for the 19th century and the beginning of commercial publishers for academic works, Fyfe seems more relevant for the 20th. 


> While his chapter does not attend specifically to the commercial content within scientific journals as I try to do here with the scientific advertisement, his chapter illuminates the ways by which commercial ventures interact with public credibility of science through the particularities of media format. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 20) 

The main taking of his chapter 'Meeting the Public', but I may need to elaborate further. 


> Baldwin’s Making ‘Nature’ takes up the relay and illustrates the continuous transformation of the journal as venue of communication for the scientific community. The book illustrates how this commercial enterprise became a sort of rendezvous point, first as the > essential reading for British men of science” at the end of the nineteenth century, passing through the journal’s popularity for physicists working in radioactivity at the turn of the twentieth, and by the 1950s, Nature having become the press of choice for scientists in the fields of geophysics and nucleic acid research. Through the 1950s and 60s, internationalisation was one of the objectives of the London press, and the journal became a venue of scientific discussion that extended beyond British borders. It was not only by widening its subscription base outside the United Kingdom that Nature established itself as an international forum, but by the constant increase of non-British contributors wishing to publish their articles.18 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 21) 

Baldwin's story: *Nature* as forum for international discussion. 


> The success of Nature as the world’s most prestigious science journal can be seen also as the success of the commercial press in the making of the scientific community. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 21) 

This is an important aspect to remember: *Nature* ***is*** a commercial publisher. 


> Baldwin rightly emphasizes how Nature was more than a bound collection of printed facts: > Nature is an important publication not only because of the famous papers printed in its pages but also because of its significance as a place where scientific practitioners have worked to define what science is and what it means to be a scientist.”19 Making ‘Nature’ is not only a history of the journal, but of the everchanging, heterogenous scientific community that contributed to its columns. Serving as a forum, Nature was the point where the community self-reflected. By looking within, the historian does not only get a view of the editorial line of Nature, but taps onto the self-identity of the liquid community that inked its paper pages. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 21) 

*Nature* as a forum: this is where the community's identity comes in, and gives way to talk about epistemic virtues and scientific selves (although I don't know if talking about 'identity' ***requires*** bringing the historiography of D&G). 


> I shall carry Baldwin’s methodological approach in referring to this community. She says that > the journal itself had no agency, and that it is more useful to consider Nature more as a dynamic forum than a self -contained unit or an unproblematic representation of science’s workforce.”20 As such, Baldwin takes an approach that I take to heart: > I have tried to avoid using ‘Nature’ as the subject of a sentence—for example, ‘Nature argued this’—but when I do, it should be taken as shorthand for ‘Nature’s editors and contributors’.”21 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 21) 

Important terminological point.
 

> Neither in Baldwin’s study of the collective self of Nature and neither on Csiszar’s account of the politics of the scientific journal, we find any description or analysis of advertisements. As such, I aim at transposing the question of identity of Baldwin with Csiszar’s interest in describing the political and > consequences” of media, using not just editorials, but the image of commercial research objects. By using the scientific advertisement, I wish to resuscitate this unindexed piece of literature. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 22) 

Indeed they don't look at it, but I am unsure about whether I will use this framework of 
- Ciszar: political consequences of media 
- Baldwin: collective self (especially unsure of this one)
 

> The question of identity – understood here as the identity of the fluid scientific community of Nature – that I pose in this thesis embraces the work in the field of historical virtue epistemology of the recent decades. I understand this approach to rely on the philosophical proposal that the epistemic and ethics of any practice (scientific practice, in this case) hinge on one another. Put in another way, that meditations on ways of knowing about the world are inseparable from a reflectivity about the one who knows, and that in short, epistemic worries and praises don’t do so without moulding the self. Put bluntly, virtue epistemology describes what is it like to be a good knower; and the historical work in this field has illustrated the situatedness of this coconstruction between knowledge making and knowledge makers” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 22) 

My approach to identity.
 

> reflections about what constitutes a good approach to knowing pivots on the condition of the knower and its placement in society. As I am interested in describing the self-identity of the community of Nature and the social worries that they reflected upon, taking a virtue epistemology framework allows me compare identities not only through the epistemic discussions, ethical discussions, and political discussions as separate conversations, but as fluid heterogeneous identities displaying different sides of their self” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 22) 

precisely this part of the sentence "and its placement in society" is a cumbersome part of the argument; as not only do I have to tie ethics (virtue) to epistemology (as D&G do), but to politics and legitimisation of research (more *à la* Csiszar)
 

> In specific, they aimed for a cultural history of epistemic virtues, in which historians > examine, for example, how epistemic inquiry was justified and conditioned in political, religious, or aesthetic terms, what sort of contexts it was supposed to require and what kind of meaning science had for different audiences.”31 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 24) 

The treatment of van Dongen and Paul of epistemic virtues is more expansive (source-wise), which is more alike to my take. If I use historical virtue epistemology, I do have to opt for and mention van Dongen and Paul's ***cultural*** historical epistemology.
 

> I situate the most salient epistemic virtues of the 1970s molecular science, and I restrict my analysis to this decade because I see it as a key moment in the history of western science. As we will see through the chapters, the pressures from public offices to the scientific community forced scientists to re-evaluate their practice and how it related to social needs, with many solutions and identities to defend. The introduction of peer review in both the publication of articles and the revision of grant proposals as a required mechanism of social evaluation was institutionally set up in the 1970s not to safeguard scientific quality, but as a manner of fencing of criticisms of parochialism by state actors.32 While I will not indulge in how the introduction of the peer review system was a political tool within a regimen of accountability, I explain the debates that made its implementation possible: a demand for science to deliver marketable results, mostly in the form of technological development. Peer review and concrete evaluative results are two aspects of the accountability problem of science which were debated and implemented as policy throughout the 1970s, and which responded to the self-image of scientists as they projected it to their public. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 25) 

This is a complex argument that serves to justify my period of analysis, but is not developed enough.
 

> This aspect of accountability brings me to my second point of departure, also related to the scope of historical virtue epistemology. I humbly offer my thesis as enrichment of the present historiography by proposing to expand the objects that the concept of ‘epistemic virtues’ explains. I aim at broadening the reach of this philosophical tool by using it not only to discuss the entanglement of ethics and epistemics in the context of scientific experimentation, but to cover also the situations outside the laboratory, namely, how scientists negotiated their place within society. The cases presented in Objectivity represent a narrow process of science, namely the practices of experimentation. As such, ‘epistemic virtues’ are almost exclusively used to explain how > practices of scientific observation and attention” are interwoven and coconstructed with ethical norms.33 ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 25) 

Again, unsure about this. This is precisely what Paul Ziche was unsure of. It would be specially irrelevant if I discuss *only* advertisements. But again, I need to ask myself: what exactly I want to say about advertisements?
 

> ‘historiographical expansion of epistemic virtues.’ ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 26)
 

> Values like ‘nationalism’ and ‘impartiality’ co-constructed each other and were highly contested arenas which not only referred to the new ways of knowing and governing, but critically hinged on ways of being modern. Maas is explicit about his historiographical positioning in respect to Objectivity, and recognises how using ‘epistemic virtues’ to explain social tension was not the designed use of Daston and Galison: ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 27) 

This is what I do.
 

> These three contributions to the field of historical virtue epistemology allow me to sketch an area where ‘epistemic virtues’ as a philosophical concept has barely stood. This is what I call here social placement of science: a relatively unexplored territory for historical studies to explain the social tensions of scientific practice as ethically knotted with epistemic commitments. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 27) 

The social placement of science: is this a relevant theoretical construct for my piece on advertisements?
 

> By seeing how the social status of science and the experimental practices themselves interacted, and how, especially from the late nineteenth century onwards, this duo was framed as a matter of public interest and state concern, we can observe that late modern science was characterised by a demand for useful, socially progressive returns on the investments by the state powers, and importantly, the ability to gaze objectively over the expenses of scientists. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 28) 

Important argument (to be complemented further with more historiography) *only if* I use the 'social placement of science' as a theoretical construct.
 

> In specific, I argue that molecular scientists during the 1970s translated their ethical obligations as responsible citizens into the epistemic virtue of molecular vision. This molecular vision was a technical one, which precisely its technicism revealed its virtue: there, at the molecular level rested the world of objective truth and morally undisturbed peace of progress. By attending only to ‘good’ experimental practices, ‘good’ science was achieved. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 28)
 

> And what about the images? What do the scientific advertisements themselves have to do with these epistemic, social, and ethical considerations (and the intricate relations between them)? ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 28) 

Exactly! What about it!?! Answer in this thesis: context is needed, moving away from representations. 
 

> The materialisation of the gene was highly dependent on technical apparatus, like those used to create x-ray diffraction images, or the enzymatic reactions needed to c leave genetic material.50 As the bodies under study went from cellular to molecular, the laboratory needed fine chemical reagents and enzymes to extract the molecules of life from living bodies. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 32) 

True, but i need more historiography on this: history of molecular techniques.
 

> Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the making of devices for the manipulation was increasingly outsourced to private manufacturers, and the biotechnology industry began having a fundamental role in laboratory biology. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 32)  

More evidence of this needed: *Private Science* is a good place to start (more below)
 

> A collection of essays in* Private Science. Biotechnology and the Rise of the Molecular Sciences* (1998) illustrates the many ways by which the commercial industry behind laboratory materials symbiotically interacted with their academic research practice. The volume, edited by Arnold Thackray, addresses notions such as ‘private’ and ‘public’ science, ‘basic’ and ‘applied’ research, analysing historically the fragility of the borders between these categories, and at the same time, shows how scientists used these concepts and other notions like ‘speed’, ‘universality’, ‘responsibility’ and ‘competition’ to fence off certain debates, promote others, and enrol financial actors in the pursuit of establishing disciplines and securing funding. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 32)
 

> Bud situates three moments that shaped the perception of genetic science as socially productive, which until then had been a fairly abstract discipline without clear applicability: first, the synthesis of a human gene for the first time in 1967 by Arthur Kornberg; second, the successful transfer (known as DNA recombination) of genetic material from one E.coli organism to another in 1973 by Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer; and third, the moratorium imposed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the United States of America on recombinant DNA technologies from 1974 to 1976. These three moments are for Bud indicative of the discursive approaches that genetic scientists used to secure their discipline and attract funding during the late 1960s and early 1970s: defend themselves from accusations of being socially detached Frankensteinian mad men, and more importantly, showing (at the time, mostly theoretically) the benefits of understanding and manipulating the molecular basis of life. The first two ‘key moments’ are an example of the image of geneticists as productive, and the NIH moratorium as the image of scientists as an ethical community willing to stop their own work for the good of society. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 33) 

This is good historiographic evidence to look at 1970s science and the advertisements for biotech stuff
 

> In her middle position, Wright argues , the ethical issues surrounding the technology were reduced to the topic of workplace safety, and safety itself reduced to > a technical question of containment.” She frames this technical reductionism and the dismantling of controls to the growing commercialisation of the molecular biology, and concretely, to the literally exponential presence of equity investing on the technologies of DNA recombination, those which were precisely under scrutiny. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 35) 

Together with Kay's chapter, Wright is what gives the political context to the laboratory science of molecular biolgy and technology. 


> What is important for this thesis is (also) that those commercial-academic relations reconfigured the identity of scientists. Now that researchers had also become > equity owners, corporate executive, and industry advisers” not only their commitments changed, but what it meant to be a ‘good’ scientist was being redefined and negotiated by written conversation in places like the printed forum. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 36) 

Full circle to scientific self. 


> Advertisements and editorial pieces, as image and texts, co-construct one another. The advertisements serve me as snapshots of the historical moment, as portraits of idealised personae and visionary laboratories, refined and purified by a forprofit commercial industry. Additionally, I will show also the functional and material aspects of advertisements, and argue that they weren’t simply a marketing tool, but intrinsic objects used in research. This will be the content of the Chapter One , ‘The advertised scientific self. Epistemic virtues of scientific instruments in Nature, and the material culture of advertisements (1970-1979).’ The editorial pieces allow me to situate these advertisements in a grander context. I will take two case studies. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 36) 

My vision of advertisements: co-construction with political context. 


> The first chapter shows the epistemic virtues highlighted in advertisements, as hyperbolised virtues that working scientists ascribed to. One of those virtues was the reliance on international companies to produce standardised objects, articulated with an increasing outsourcing of the making of devices and reactives. This outsourcing is an example of the increasing hyper-specialisation of science, not (only) in terms of subject matter, but also of the kind of work being done. With the making of research instruments being subcontracted to commercial companies, the job of scientists was narrowed to > observing and recording results,” as one of the manufacturers put it. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 38) 

Advancing argument in chapter one.
