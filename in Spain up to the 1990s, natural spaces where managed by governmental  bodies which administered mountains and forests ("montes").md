In Spain up to the 1990s, natural spaces where managed by governmental  bodies which administered mountains and forests ("montes"). Since the 1970s, ICONA was the main institution, and the 1975 'Ley de Espaios Naturales' being the main law.

The conservation of nature was then highly controlled by framed as a matter of managing mountains, forest, fishing, and hunting.
