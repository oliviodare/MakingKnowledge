### Belgian Biodiversity Platform
[Website](https://www.biodiversity.be/).
According to Vincent Cuypers, it's not really an institution, but a loose group of connected institutions working on biodiversity.

## 2. Locally-involved scientific community
### Natuurpunt - Natagora
Natuurpunt: flemish version
Natagora: wallonian version

### INBO (Research Institute for Nature and Forest, Flanders)
[Website](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en-gb/homepage/).
Recommended by Tom Artois, they compile and mantain redlists of species in Flanders.
They are also concerned about [invasive species](#Invasive%20species%20'biodiversity'%20where%20it%20shouldn't%20be): https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en-gb/researchdomains/invasieve-soorten/indicators.

### Youth naturalist associations
Local associations where younger (conservation) and older (identification, collection) notions about nature and diversity coexist. 

### Local communities that may have been displaced or whose land right have been 
This doesn't have to be by going to the Global South, but I am sure these kind of cases did happen in places like Belgium or Spain (Doñana) and I could investigate those tensions. See [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), citation p. 5.

### Looking at wetlands
Wetlands are the 'ultimate biodiversity hotspot', see this [IUCN's post](https://www.iucn.org/crossroads-blog/202001/wetlands-ultimate-biodiversity-hotspot)

## 3. Beyond conservation (some more, some less)
### Seed banks
À la [2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md). Perhaps worth to look at 'Biodiversity International' and its predecesor, the 'International Board for Plant Genetic Resources' ([2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md), page 27, footnotes 56, 57).

More recent seed banks: [Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://www.croptrust.org/what-we-do/svalbard-global-seed-vault), the so-called Doomsday Seed Vault dug into Arctic tundra on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, or the [Millennium Global Seed Bank](http://www.kew.org/scienceconservation/collections/millennium-seed-bank) in Wakehurst, England, which aims to have 25 percent of the world's bankable seed by 2020.

### Invasive species: 'biodiversity' where it shouldn't be
Animals that migrate to regions where they aren't endemic as a cause of climate change. In this way, 'biodiversity' has a very different meaning. Examples in Belgium: canaries, kingfisher, wasp spider, dragonflies. 
See stand-alone note: [2013-Sartori](2013-Sartori.md).


### Voting and democracy in conservation science
This could be a link with the taxonomic disorder. How does democracy and governance work in the management of the 'biodiversity' crisis?

### Anchovy crisis (France, Spain)
