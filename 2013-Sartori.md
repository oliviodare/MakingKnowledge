**Take-home message**: This may be a potential good lead for a [case study](üå±%20biodiv--cases%20to%20study.md): what about when 'biodiversity' isn't a good value in itself? Several points to work with:
- Interesting the framing as an 'invasion' and the ambiguous relation of national boundaries with 'native biodiversity'. See below for a commentary on the two dimensions causing conceptual ambiguity. 
- Risk management seems to be one of the mechanisms of dealing with the biodiversity crisis.  
- People to look at: 
	- Janez Potoƒçnik, European Commissioner for the Environment (in 2013).
	- Dr Paul Walton, Head of Habitats and Species at the RSPB.
	- Julia Marton-Lefevre, Director General of IUCN.
- Institutions to look at:
	- [BirdLife](https://www.birdlife.org/).
	- [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://www.iucn.org/), IUCN.
	- [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds](https://www.rspb.org.uk/), RSPB.
- Processes to look at:
	- EU legislative proposal from September 2013: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_13_818.

## Reading notes


> They cause some 12.5 billion Euro worth of damage each year in the European Union alone. [...] More than 10,000 alien species have gained a foothold in Europe, from Asian tiger mosquitoes to North American ragweed, and at least 1,500 are known to be harmful.

Invasive species framed as a source of economic downfall. 

> On 21 February BirdLife and IUCN co-hosted an event in the European Parliament in Brussels to shed some light on this ticking time bomb, ahead of the EU legislative proposal aimed at tackling the problem, which is expected in March.

This is an event and organisations that I maybe want to look at.

> One of the better known examples of the economic damages caused by an Invasive Alien Species is the case of the American comb jelly fish in the Black Sea. The jelly fish arrived in the ballast water of ships from the American Atlantic coast. With no enemies in their new home, the jellies propagated at an alarming rate. The invasion contributed to the near collapse of Black Sea commercial fisheries within a few years and was a main contributor to the loss of 150 000 fishing jobs as a direct effect of the reduction of anchovies.

This seems to be a well-known case: American jelly fish, propagating in the Black Sea.

> European Commissioner for the Environment, Janez Potoƒçnik stated in his opening address that the root of the problem is related to the effects of globalisation with an increase in travel and trade around the globe. Most of the alien species arrive in our clothing, luggage and in freight. 

Potential person of interest: Janez Potoƒçnik.

> About 10-15% of all alien species in Europe are indeed invasive, meaning that they establish, **spread and cause harm to the native biodiversity** and also to human health and our ecosystem services.

This is the key worry: harming the 'native biodiversity', a concept that not only has the [conceptual flexibility of *biodiversity*](where%20can%20conceptual%20ambiguity%20of%20'biodiveristy'%20come%20from?.md) but adds on another dimension of ambiguity: what counts as *native* biodiversity (i.e., what counts as *native* species). And a very interesting question: ['Do non-native species count as biodiversity?'](2018-Simberloff.md).

> ‚ÄùInvasive Alien Species know no boundaries‚Äù, the Commissioner stated and suggested that Europe needs guiding principles to solve the problem.

Interesting metaphoric nationalism language. 

> Considering the serious impact that the IAS have on Member States, a risk based approach is recommended. Europe should focus its efforts on **prevention rather than reaction** with bans on particular species, thus preventing them from entering the EU. Developing existing systems, such as border controls, would also be a way of maximising the efficiency of the legislation.

Addressing the biodiversity crisis by managing risks: [what is the late-modern concept of 'risk'?](what%20is%20the%20late-modern%20concept%20of%20'risk'?).

> Dr Paul Walton, Head of Habitats and Species at the RSPB said that ‚Äúdespite the action taken, the problem is still getting worse and climate change only makes it easier for IAS to settle.‚Äù

Another person to look at.

> IUCN Director General Julia Marton-Lefevre closed the meeting by calling for a public awareness campaign ‚Äúmaking the public feel like citizen scientists‚Äù, meaning that people can take action in their home town as they become aware of the damage caused by certain species, and learning about which they are.

Another person to look at.
And odd link to 'citizen science' ‚Äì how can individual people "in their home" becoming "aware of the damage caused by certain species" do any good in large-scale?
