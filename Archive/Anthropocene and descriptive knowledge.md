### Thoughts and a question
Is the form of these new nowledge kinds  (history *for* the antrhopocene, geoanthropology, earth-system sciences, or Anthropocenic Historical Knowledge, as the first speaker suggested) apt for the challenges of today? And concretely, what is the role of descriptive knowledges in creating new forms of knowledge for the anthropocene?

These new proposals for the ways in which we do science and humanities are critical of linear and localised ways knowledge forms. So, how do these new forms relate to the science as managment of chaos and uncertainty that history long critised? (Are these new knowledge forms still use for management crisis?) More specifically, what is the role of descriptive knowledge in these new sciences? It seems that the forms of communication aren't changing, just the content. The form and context in which academics are going to do this work seems to be the same - what is the role of our lifestyle as academics (research, writing, speaking, describing, claiming, making abstractions and models) related to the kinds of changes we want our knowledges to exert?

In short, is knowing by describing what is going on really what the anthropocene needs?

descriptive, declarative, analytical

vs

procedural, knowing-how knowledge
