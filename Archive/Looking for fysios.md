If you work in the Netherlands and are registered to be living in Belgium you will have to take out a Dutch general insurance. In Belgium you can apply for a treaty policy. With a treaty policy you are insured in Belgium under the Belgian conditions.   

> **Cover under general insurance**  
For care that is covered by the Dutch general insurance (if you don't qualify for a treaty policy in Belgium) under the Zorgkeuze polis we would reimburse 100% of the invoice up to the amount we find reasonable. Reimbursement under the general insurance is first set off against your outstanding deductible.  
If you would choose our Zorgbewust general insurance we would reimburse not contracted healthcare (in Belgium most healthcare providers have no contract with us) for 70% of the invoice up to a maximum of 70% of the amount we would reimburse for the same care at contracted healthcare providers.  

> **Physiotherapy**   
Sometimes physiotherapy is reimbursed under the general insurance and if so often the first 20 treatments would not be included. Most if the time we reimburse physiotherapy under our additional insurances. Not contracted physiotherapy covered by our additional insurances is reimbursed for 50% of the invoice to a maximum of 50% of what we would reimburse for the same care at contracted healthcare providers.
