Collaboration with UMC

We have the opportunity to participate in an interesting collaborative project with the Utrecht New School and UMC.

Yesterday, Stefan, Jobke and myself had a meeting with Stefan van Geelen from the UMC/New School. As a colleague of our Stefan, he learned about our journal and is very enthusiastic about our philosophy and initiatives.

At the end of February, Stefan van Geelen will be applying for a grant, approximately 30,000 EUR, in order to investigate uncertainties. He has two main projects, one focusing on **uncertainty** in virtual communication and one focusing on narratives of chronically ill children and adolescents. We are now exploring the possibility of contributing to this grant proposal, for possible funding to the tune of 10,000 EUR.

**The line of thinking goes: Individuals have lost the ability to deal with uncertainty -> There is no room for trial and error. **

This would be a fantastic opportunity for collaboration and Stefan van Geelen has some great ideas of how our project and his project can fit together.

In the meeting, we already discussed the possibility of workshops and a special issue, but we would like to have a larger discussion with more of the team.

There is another meeting planned with Stefan van Geelen for next week on Wednesday the 17th, at which time we plan to offer a more detailed and robust proposal.Â
