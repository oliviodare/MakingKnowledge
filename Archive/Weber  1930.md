**Take-home message**: The argument is pretty simple: protestantism (starting with Luther and the Calvin) set the ground for the establishment of an ethical paradigm to which capitalism is indebted. This paradigm contains: a method for self-discipline and tailoring human behaviour and though, a rationalist approach to the fullfilment of a God-given calling, and a negation of emotion and enjoyment as detrimental to that calling. 
Aside the historical relevance of the book, I may also want to futher have a look at the historiographical and methodological contribution of Weber, namely it's approach to historical actors and analysis using 'ideal types', and the possible links of ideal types to to a conceptual history approach.

###  CHAPTER 1. RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION

> ... it is a fact that the Protestants (especially certain branches of the movement to be fully discussed later) both as ruling classes and as ruled, both as a majority and as minority, have shown a special tendency to develop economic rationalism which cannot be observed to the same extent among Catholics either in the one situtation or in the other. Thus the principal explanation of this difference must be sough in the permanent intrinsic character of their religious beliefs, and not only in their termporary external historico-political situations. (p 7)

Here he presents the main finding to be explained (the capitalist tendency of certain people, and the appararent association with a given religion) and the kind of 'essentialist' explanation he is after. However, it is unclear still what is meant by 'external'. However, later is obvious that this is in reference and opposition with a Marxist interpretation. 
<br>
<br>

> .... the supposed confilct between other-worldliness, asceticism, and ecclesiastical piety on the one side, and participation in capitalistic acquisition on the other, might actually turn out to be an intimate relationship. (p9)

<br>
<br>

> ... the spirit of hard work, of progress, or whatever else it may be called, the awakening of which one is inclined to ascribe to Protestantism, must not be understood, as there is a tendency to do, as joy of living nor in any other sense as connected with the Enlightenment. The old Protestantism of Luther, Calvin, Knox, Voet, had precious little to do with what to-day is called progress. To whole aspects of modern life which the msot extreme religionist would not wish to supress to-day, it was directly hostile. If any inner relationship between certain expressions of the old Protestant spirit and modern capitalistic culture is to be found, we must attent to find it, for better of worse not in its alleged more or less materialistic or at least anti-ascetic joy of living, but in its purely religious characteristics. Montesquieu  say (*Espirit des Lois*, Book XX, chap. 7) of the English that they "had progressed the farthest of all peoples of the world in three important things: in piety, in commerce, and in freedom". Is it no possible that their commercial superioirty and their adaptation to free political institutions are connected in some way with that recored of piety which Montesquieu ascribes to them? (p11)

### CHAPTER 2. THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM
> If any object can be found to which this term [spirit of capitalism] can be applied which any understandable meaning, it can only be an historical individual, i.e. a complex of elements associated in historical reality which we unite into a conceptual whole from the standpoint of their cultural significance. (p13)

This is how he defines a 'historical concept' of sorts, interesting bringing up "cultural significance." He aims to provide a 'definition' of spirit in cultural historical terms --> what influcence did this have on [[Koselleck]]'s conceptual history?
<br>
<br>

> The result of this is that it is by no means necessary to understand by the spirit of capitalism only what it will come to mean to *us* for the purpose of our analysis. This is a necessary result of the nature of historical concepts which atttempt for their methodological purposes not to grasp historical reality in abstract general formulae, but in concrete genetic sets of relations which are inevitably of a specifically unique and individual chracter. (p14)

This is nice, but I am still unclear of the meaning of 'unique' and 'individual' here. Is he being somewhat normative about what historical concepts should do? E.g., saying that concepts should be able to gather historical individuality into some "genetic sets"? Seems relevant for any study using [[ideal types]] and maybe also [[conceptual history]]. More on this on a quote below. 
<br>
<br>

> The peculiarity of this philosophy of avarice appears to be the ideal of the honest man of recognized credit, and above all the idea of a duty of the individual towards the increase of his capital, which is assumed as an end in itself. Truly what is here preced in not simply a means of making one's way in the world, but a peculiar ethic.. The infraction of its rules is treated not as foolishnes but as forgetfulness of duty. That is the essence of the matter. It is not mere business astuteness, that sort of tihng is common enough, it is an ethos. *This* is the quality which interests us. (p17)

This is the immediate commentary of the long quotation of Benjamin Franklin, and a good definition of the spirit of capitalism. 
<br>
<br>

> In fact, the *summum bonum* of this ethic, the earning of more and more money, combined with the strict avoidance of all spontaneuous enjoyment of life, is above all completely devoid of any eudaemonistic, not to say hedonistic, admixture. It is so purley as an end in itself, that from the point of view of the hapinnes of, or utility to, the single individual, ti appears entirely transcendental and absolutely irrational. (p18)

(i)rrationality and progress. A contextual approach to rationality. 
<br>
<br>

> And in truth this peculiar idea, so familiar to su to-day, but in reality so little a matter of course, of one's duty in a calling, is what is most characteristic of the social ehtic of capitalistic cutlure, and is ina sense the fundamental basis of it. (p19)
<br>
<br>

>  Thus the capitalism of to-day, which has come to dominate economic life, educates and selects the economic subjects which it needs through a process of economic survival of the fittest. But here one can easily see the limits of the concept of selection as a means of historical explanation. In order that a manner of life so well adapted to the peculiarities of capitalism could be selected at all, i.e. should come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to whole groups of men. This origin is what really needs explanation. Concerning the doctrine of the more naïve historical materialism, that such ideas originate as a reflection or superstructure of economic situations, we shall speak more in detail below. (p20)

An elucidation of the relation between individuals and community, and a critique of a Marxist interpretation of the relationship between religion affiliation and development of capitalism 

>  And the *auri sacra* fames of a Neapolitan cab-driver or *barcaiuolo*, and certainly of Asiatic representatives of similar trades, as well as of the craftsmen of southern European or Asiatic countries, is, as anyone can find out for himself, very much more intense, and especially more unscrupulous than that of, say, an Englishman in similar circumstances. ... Capitalism cannot make use of the labour of those who practise the doctrine of undisciplined liberum arbitrium, any more than it can make use of the business man who seems absolutely unscrupulous in his dealings with others, as we can learn from Franklin. Hence the difference does not lie in the degree of development of any impulse to make money. (p21)

Capitalism is something beyond greed and unscrupulousness. In fact, capitalism *needs* discipline. 
<br>
<br>

>  The most important opponent with which the spirit of capitalism, in the sense of a definite standard of life claiming ethical sanction, has had to struggle, was that type of attitude and reac- tion to new situations which we may designate as traditionalism. (p23)  ... The opportunity of earning more was less attractive than that of working less. He did not ask: how much can I earn in a day if I do as much work as possible? but: how much must I work in order to earn the wage, 21⁄2 marks, which I earned before and which takes care of my traditional needs? This is an example of what is here meant by traditionalism. A man does not “by nature” wish to earn more and more money, but simply to live as he is accustomed to live and to earn as much as is necessary for that purpose. (p24)

How "traditionalism" opposes capitalism. 
<br>
<br>

>  Labour must, on the contrary, be performed as if it were an absolute end in itself, a calling. But such an attitude is by no means a product of nature. It cannot be evoked by low wages or high ones alone, but can only be the product of a long and arduous process of education. (p25)

In the previous he attacked Marxist arguments (lowering wages, raising wages) and said there were not enough, giving some room for the need to bring 'education' (and so also, religion) as cultural explanation for the rise of capitalism.
<br>
<br>

>  Nevertheless, we provisionally use the expression spirit of (modern) capitalism to describe that attitude which seeks profit rationally and systematically in the manner which we have illustrated by the example of Benjamin Franklin. This, however, is justified by the historical fact that that attitude of mind has on the one hand found its most suitable expression in capitalistic enterprise, while on the other the enterprise has derived its most suitable motive force from the spirit of capitalism. (p27/8)

A provisional definition of "spirit of capitalism". The idea behind is that spirit defines enterprise, i.e., though -> action. But then followed by ...

>  But the two may very well occur separately. Benjamin Franklin was filled with the spirit of capitalism at a time when his printing business did not differ in form from any handicraft enterprise. And we shall see that at the beginning of modern times it was by no means the capitalistic entrepreneurs of the commercial aristocracy, who were either the sole or the pre- dominant bearers of the attitude we have here called the spirit of capitalism. (p28)

... at the same time, there is a contigent relation
<br>
<br>

> Furthermore, along with clarity of vision and ability to act, it is only by virtue of very definite and highly developed ethical qualities that it has been possible for him to command the absolutely indispensable confidence of his customers and workmen. Nothing else could have given him the strength to overcome the innumerable obstacles, above all the infinitely more intensive work which is demanded of the modern entre- preneur. But these are ethical qualities of quite a different sort from those adapted to the traditionalism of the past. (p31)

The new ethos.
<br>
<br>
 

> It might thus seem that the development of the spirit of capitalism is best understood as part of the development of rational- ism as a whole, and could be deduced from the fundamental position of rationalism on the basic problems of life. In the process Protestantism would only have to be considered in so far as it had formed a stage prior to the development of a purely rationalistic philosophy. But it remained most backward in some of the countries with the highest degree of economic rationalization, notably in England, where the Renaissance of Roman Law was overcome by the power of the great legal corporations, while it has always retained its supremacy in the Catholic countries of Southern Europe. The worldly rational philosophy of the eighteenth century did not find favour alone or even principally in the countries of highest capitalistic development. (p37/8)

Rationality is not *enough*. And continues:

> In fact, one may—this simple proposition, which is often forgotten should be placed at the beginning of every study which essays to deal with rationalism—rationalize life from fundamentally different basic points of view and in very differ- ent directions. Rationalism is an historical concept which covers a whole world of different things. (p38) ...  the idea of a calling and the devotion to labour in the calling has grown, which is, as we have seen, so **irrational** from the **standpoint** of purely eudæmonistic self-interest,  but which has been and still is one of the most characteristic elements of our capitalistic culture. (p38)

Contextual rationality

### CHAPTER 3. LUTHER'S CONCEPTION OF THE CALLING

> The conception of the calling thus brings out that central dogma of all Protestant denominations which the Catholic division of eth- ical precepts into prœcepta and consilia discards. The only way of living acceptably to God was not to surpass worldly morality in monastic asceticism, but solely through the fulfilment of the obligations imposed upon the individual by his position in the world. That was his calling. (p40)

> The monastic life is not only quite devoid of value as a means of justification before God, but he also looks upon its renunciation of the duties of this world as the product of selfishness, withdrawing from temporal obligations. In con- trast, labour in a calling appears to him as the outward expres- sion of brotherly love. This he proves by the observation that the division of labour forces every individual to work for others, but his view-point is highly naïve, forming an almost grotesque contrast to Adam Smith’s well-known statements on the same subject

###  CHAPTER 4. THE RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONS OF WORLDLY ASCETICISM

> It is common knowledge that Lutherans have again and again accused this line of thought, which was worked out in the Reformed Churches and sects with increasing clarity, of reversion to the doctrine of salvation by works. And however justi- fied the protest of the accused against identification of their dogmatic position with the Catholic doctrine, this accusation has surely been made with reason if by it is meant the practical consequences for the everyday life of the average Christian of the Reformed Church. For a more intensive form of the religious valuation of moral action than that to which Calvinism led its adherents has perhaps never existed. But what is important for the practical significance of this sort of salvation by works must be sought in a knowledge of the particular qualities which characterized their type of ethical conduct and distinguished it from the everyday life of an average Christian of the Middle Ages. The difference may well be formulated as follows: the normal mediæval Catholic layman lived ethically, so to speak, from hand to mouth. In the first place he conscientiously fulfilled his traditional duties. But beyond that minimum his good works did not necessarily form a connected, or at least not a rationalized, system of life, but rather remained a succession of individual acts. He could use them as occasion demanded, to atone for particular sins, to better his chances for salvation, or, toward the end of his life, as a sort of insurance premium. Of course the Catholic ethic was an ethic of intentions. But the concrete intentio of the single act determined its value. And the single good or bad action was credited to the doer determining his temporal and eternal fate. Quite realistically the Church recognized that man was not an absolutely clearly defined unity to be judged one way or the other, but that his moral life was normally subject to conflicting motives and his action contradictory. (p70)

Good summary of the different ways of salvation by Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists, the latter with a rational system of good works. 
<br>
<br>

> Now that systematization of ethical conduct which the asceticism of Calvinistic Protestantism had in common with the rational forms of life in the Catholic orders is expressed quite superficially in the way in which the conscientious Puritan continually supervised his own state of grace. To be sure, the religious account-books in which sins, temptations, and progress made in grace were entered or tabulated were common to both the most enthusiastic Reformed circles and some parts of modern Catholicism (especially in France), above all under the influence of the Jesuits. (p76)

**Sin-accounting!**

> the most important result of ascetic Protestantism, a systematic rational ordering of the moral life as a whole. The Lutheran faith thus left the spontaneous vitality of impulsive action and naïve emotion more nearly unchanged. The motive to constant self-control and thus to a deliberate regulation of one’s own life, which the gloomy doctrine of Calvinism gave, was lacking. (p79)

***The main teaching of the book***...
<br>
<br>
 
> The religious life of the saints, as distinguished from the natural life, was—the most important point—no longer lived outside the world in monastic communities, but within the world and its institutions. This rationalization of conduct within this world, but for the sake of the world beyond, was the consequence of the concept of calling of ascetic Protestantism. (p100)

### CHAPTER 3. ASCETICISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM

 

> One of the fundamental elements of the spirit of modern capitalism, and not only of that but of all modern culture: rational conduct on the basis of the idea of the calling, was born—that is what this discussion has sought to demonstrate— from the spirit of Christian asceticism. One has only to re-read the passage from Franklin, quoted at the beginning of this essay, in order to see that the essential elements of the attitude which was there called the spirit of capitalism are the same as what we have just shown to be the content of the Puritan worldly asceti- cism, only without the religious basis, which by Franklin’s time had died away. (p122/123)
