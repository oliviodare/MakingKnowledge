# what are the different ideal type approaches to Nature in conservation biology and related fields?

[1985-Soulé](1985-Soulé.md) argued that conseration biology differs from other existing disciplines such as fisheries biology and forestry in that the latter ones do not operate on aesthetic or intrinsic values but on "commercial" and "recreational" incentives, as well as being narrowed to natural resources that are relevant for human use; while conservation biology aims for a more holistic approach.

This makes me think that it could be a good idea for me to take investigate the ideal types of the different reasons for attending/conserving a given environment (commercial, recreational, ethical, aesthetic, indigenous use...), which could be a good way to conceptually map approaches to Nature (alhtough I am sure this has been done). In this way, I can take a #conceptualhistory appraoch and see the diachronic structures that allow, for instance, the cognitive separation of commercial from indigenous use, or the aesthetic from the "holistic"; and how use and profit relate to each other given the lingustic pre-givens, to use Koselleck's terms.
