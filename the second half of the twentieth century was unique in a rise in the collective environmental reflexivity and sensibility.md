# the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility
#conceptnote

From the Cold War, there's been a rise in the sensibility towards the reach of human influence in the spaces we inhabit. 

One of those texts that contributed to fostering such 'reflexivity' and 'sensibility' is [Carson](1996-Takacs.md#Rachel%20Carson%201907â€“64)'s *Silent Spring*. The book was widely successfull, and according to [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), it "popularized the trend among ecologists of reifying nature as a concrete entity" (p. 27). The term 'reification' is important here, and we argue that [the reification of biodiversity was the late-20c process of recognising natural variety as a tangigle, valuable, and manageable entity](the%20reification%20of%20biodiversity%20was%20the%20late-20c%20process%20of%20recognising%20natural%20variety%20as%20a%20tangigle,%20valuable,%20and%20manageable%20entity.md).

As noted in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md), institutions like the NATO, both scientists and military officers worked on issues that gave rise to the concept of the 'environment issue', like environmental warfare, radiological contamination, biological weapons, weather control, etc. 

[2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md) argues that the 1970s and 1980s were important in the development of the [[endangerment sensibility]] because diversity and extinction were recast as through a new biological understanding: [[in the 1970s, 'biodiversity' was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'exctinction']]
