# the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility

From the Cold War, there's been a rise in the sensibility towards the reach of human influence in the spaces we inhabit. 

As noted in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md), institutions like the NATO, both scientists and military officers worked on issues that gave rise to the concept of the 'environment issue', like environmental warfare, radiological contamination, biological weapons, weather control, etc. 

[2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md) argues that the 1970s and 1980s were important in the development of the [[endangerment sensibility]] because diversity and extinction were recast as through a new biological understanding: [[in the 1970s, 'biodiversity' was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'exctinction']]
