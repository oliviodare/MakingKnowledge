# the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility
#conceptnote

From the Cold War, there's been a rise in the sensibility towards the reach of human influence in the spaces we inhabit. 

As noted in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md), institutions like the NATO, both scientists and military officers worked on issues that gave rise to the concept of the 'environment issue', like environmental warfare, radiological contamination, biological weapons, weather control, etc.
