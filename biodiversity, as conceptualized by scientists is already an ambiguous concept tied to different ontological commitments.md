# *biodiversity*, as conceptualized by scientists is already an ambiguous concept tied to different ontological commitments
#conceptnote

We see in [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) that *biodiversity* has come to mean a lot of things to scientists (only). To this variety, we can imagine that other's actors add on to this diversity. For scientists, *biodiversity* is a synonym of life, a property of life, a value, a measure, a product, a thing in nature, and a statistical feature of living systems. This shows us that the conceptual confusion around *biodiversity* is not just a matter of debates about how to measure it, but it's in fact an ontological confusion: from property, to measure, to statistical feature, to an outright real element of nature: there are as many positions as points in the realism-antirealism continuum.

The observation that there is a wide array of conceptualisations is one of the central empirical arguments that supports the idea that [biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation](biodiversity%20is%20not%20an%20analytic%20concept%20but%20a%20political%20motivation.md).
