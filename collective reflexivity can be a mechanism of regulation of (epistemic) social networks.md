# collective reflexivity can be a mechanism of regulation of (epistemic) social networks
#conceptnote

[2020b-Renn](2020b-Renn.md) argues that *awareness* of belonging to a given network (e.g., to a collective identity or a given social strucutre with several labor-differentiation aimed at a particular goal) can modulate the network itself (by, for instance, strenghtening some social connections, or encouraging the pursuit of enrolling certain material or semiotic elements into the network).  

This insight from Renn's perspective on SNA and his theory for the history of knowledge evolution may shed some light onto my question of [what is the late-modern concept of 'reflexivity'?](what%20is%20the%20late-modern%20concept%20of%20'reflexivity'?.md).
