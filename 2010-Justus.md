# Highlights and Notes

> "Helping rectify this, Maclaurin and Sterelny make a novel and valuable contribution to the growing scientifically oriented philosophical literature on biodiversity" ([Justus 2010:247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=1))

> "While other analyses of biodiversity focus primarily on ecological diversity, eight relatively short chapters (and brief conclusion) cover: disciplinary and legal circumstances in which the concept of biodiversity emerged (Chap. 1);" ([Justus 2010:247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=1))

> "taxonomic methodologies and their bearing on characterizing biodiversity (Chap. 1), especially different accounts of species (Chap. 2); differences and relationships between species richness and disparity (Chap. 3);" ([Justus 2010:247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=1))

> "morphological, developmental, and ecological diversity (Chaps. 4-6);" ([Justus 2010:247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=1))

> "and the problems in measuring and valuing biodiversity in conservation biology (Chaps. 7-8)" ([Justus 2010:247](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=1))

> " How this diversity should be characterized depends upon how these systems are represented, particularly on how their parts are individuated, classified, and distributed among those classes. Representations may vary with different explanatory or predictive scientific goals, and across types of systems, so characterizations of diversity may vary across these contexts as well. This underpins MacClaurin and Sterelny's expressly pluralistic approach throughout the book, as opposed to the view that biodiversity designates a *single* property of biological systems, an assumption implicit in some biologists' language and explicitly endorsed by some philosophers (e.g. Holmes Rolston)." ([Justus 2010:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

> "This reflects a general concern to represent biodiversity as an effect and cause of ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes." ([Justus 2010:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

Here biodiversity is conceptualised as a scientific concept, not an inherently political one. ([note on p.248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

 

> "'Disparity' designates the degree of such interspecific phenotypic variation" ([Justus 2010:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

Another concept associated with biodiversity ([note on p.248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

 
> "Chapter 4 convincingly shows that morphospace distance can supply a principled measurement methodology, providing the disparity concept with the empirical and theoretical tractability science requires. Morphospaces are multidimensional spaces, each dimension representing a distinct morphological feature of actual, or merely possible, organisms; David Raup's 4-dimensional morphospace for mollusk shells is a well-known example (pp. 67-72)" ([Justus 2010:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

morphoespace, another associated concept. Don’t really understand it yet. ([note on p.248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

 

> "After describing different forms of developmental plasticity and their likely significant role in maintaining biodiversity against environmental perturbation in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 defends a local, nonindividualistic conception of biological communities. Part of the view holds biological communities have emergent causal properties, i.e. ones that do not "simply reflect" properties of their constituent populations." ([Justus 2010:248](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=2))

> "This conception of stability is thus a poor indicator of the kind of higher-level causal integration the emergence claim requires" ([Justus 2010:249](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=3))

This reminds me to the discussion in Sarkar 2002 of biodiversity surrogates ([note on p.249](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=3))

 

> "After describing difficulties with these broader measures, specifically the methods developed for assessing genetic and phylogenetic diversity (e.g. the minimum spanning path method due to Dan Faith), Maclaurin and Sterelny consider the pervasive use of biodiversity surrogates in conservation biology. In real-world conservation planning, biodiversity is operationalised with surrogates: biotic and/or abiotic variables—such as the presence or absence of species, climatic, or geological factors—which are easily assayed for a region, for instance through relatively inexpensive surveys or remote sensing. Surrogates are then used to prioritize areas for conservation within that region. Information about what surrogates are where is the basis for these prioritizations, not surrogate richness" ([Justus 2010:249](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=3))

real-world is equalled to conservation biology; conservation policy-making is forgotten ([note on p.249](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=3))

 

> "Biodiversity surrogates can be, and often are, sets of species, so this fact about area-prioritization reinforces the view emphasized throughout the book and widely held among conservation biologists that biodiversity is not adequately characterized as species richness. Maclaurin and Sterelny note that the choice of surrogates is partly conventional, depending on the interests of those studying biodiversity, but they also stress that the relationship between different sets of surrogates is an empirical, and largely unresolved issue." ([Justus 2010:249](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=3))

There may be something to be researched too regarding pragmatism and convention in the search for viable *and* philosophically justifiable measures of biodiversity ([note on p.250](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=4))

 

> "This illustrates the multifaceted nature of biodiversity and motivates their pluralistic approach, but one wonders whether a unique characterization of biodiversity could be formulated in some circumstances" ([Justus 2010:250](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=4))

> "Chapter 8 concludes with a cogent examination of daunting problems with valuing biodiversity, illuminating the issues with theories of speciation and taxonomy considered earlier. In all the chapters, the analysis is scientifically informed and philosophically adept. This book, like the few others on biodiversity from a scientifically oriented philosophical perspective, will rightly help set the agenda for work in the philosophy of conservation biology, and environmental science in general." ([Justus 2010:250](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=4))

Seems that the book mostly focus on the philosophy of scientific literature, not talking much about the practice and seemingly nothing about politics. ([note on p.250](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXCBRAFX?page=4)) [philosophy of species takes scientific literature to be the main object of study](philosophy%20of%20species%20takes%20scientific%20literature%20to%20be%20the%20main%20object%20of%20study.md)
