# How do I study my sources?

Study:
- knowledge circulation
	- format of knowledge
	- what is the role of institutional credibility (specially the policy-oriented)
	- see different analytical tools in [there are several ways to analyse 'knowledge transmission'](there%20are%20several%20ways%20to%20analyse%20'knowledge%20transmission'.md) and [2020-Renn](2020-Renn.md).
- implementation of scientific knowledge
- success?
