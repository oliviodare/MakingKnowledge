**Take-home message**: This seems to be one of the seminal conceptual papers on biodiversity. I apprecieate that  it is philosophically attentive, and in fact, quite dense at times. It marries conceptual clarification with the inherent practical (and sociopolitical, towards the end) implications of conservation biology. It proposes several ways of conceptualising and measuring diversity, with two main theoretical constructs: true surrogates of biodiversity, and estimator surrogates.

## Reading notes


> The neologism 'biodiversity' was coined by Walter G. Rosen at some point during the organization of the 21-24 September 1986 "National Forum on BioDiversity" held in Washington, D.C., under the auspices of 2 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution. The new term was intended as nothing more than a shorthand for "biological diversity" for use in internal paperwork during the organization of that forum.

The bird of ‘biodiversity’ as a neologism in 1986. #timeline:[1986 National Forum on BioDiversity](🗓️%20biodiv--a%20rough%20list%20of%20events.md#1986%20National%20Forum%20on%20BioDiversity).


> The Washington forum was held only shortly after the founding of the U.S. Society for Conservation Biology in 1985 which, sociologically, marked the formation of a new inter-disciplinary field dedicated to the conservation of biological diversity.

Supposed origins of conservation biology linked to the concept of ‘biodiveristy’ as such, with the establishment of a US society.

> Michael E. Soulé's (1985) manifesto for the new discipline, "What Is Conservation Biology?"

Manifesto.

> Within ecology, Daniel H. Janzen's (1986) exhortation to tropical ecologists to undertake the political activism necessary for conservation fortuitously appeared in 1986.

Inherent political origins of the discipline.

> Nevertheless, the term 'biodiversity' has remained remarkably vague and its measurement equally capricious. Is allelic diversity part of biodiversity? Or only species? What about individual differences? Do we have to worry about community structure? Is the number of species the appropriate measure? Do we have to take rarity and commonality into account? Or should we worry about differences between places?

the species problem is not the only conceptual vagueness of ‘biodiversity’! Not just a matter of lack of ‘species’ definition, but also genetic, individual, group, etc. 

If this is the discussion in 2002, and Garnett and Les Christidis 2017 is what is debated today, there seems to be a narrowing of the issue from a matter of the ontology and epistemology of ‘biodiversity’ to the ‘species problem’, equating thus ‘biodiveristy’ with ‘species diversity’.

> The purpose of this paper is an initial attempt to add enough precision to the concept of biodiversity to make its ordinal, if not quantitative, assessment plausible. This is done by returning the discussion of what biodiversity means from the abstract space in which it usually occurs to the definite historically contingent context in which the term emerged: 'biodiversity' must be analyzed in the context of conservation biology and what it, as a goal-oriented enterprise that prescribes policies, must accomplish as it tries to conserve biodiversity.

Paper’s aim. Is this an HPS paper?

Biodiversity in the political context of conservation science.

> Put bluntly, the position that this paper will argue for is that biodiversity is to be (implicitly)  defined as what is being conserved by the practice of conservation biology.

Institutional definition of biodiversity —> I like!

> This makes medicine different from, say, physiology; and conservation biology different from ecology. Those two latter disciplines try to obey the imperative of generalization that conventionally marks good science (though 7 not necessarily always with success, especially in the case of ecology). Medicine and conservation biology are constrained from following that imperative over everything else: they must ensure that the peculiar individual entity that they are treating survives even if procedures unique to it have to be crafted. The medical analog of "biodiversity" is "health," equally difficult to define explicitly, but implicitly embedded in the practice of good medicine.

Ecology/Physiology as pure sciences, and Conservation Biology/Medicine as applied sciences. May want to look into this comparison also from a historiographical perspective —> bringing history of medicine as an analytic framework to study conservation biology.

> ameliorative and preventive medicine.

> We practice conservation biology's analog of ameliorative medicine when, for instance, we allow a species to fall into decline and then make attempts at its recuperation.

> when we usually invoke the Endangered Species Act, we are in the emergency room.

> But just as a definition of health would be skewed if we were to rely solely on the measures we take in emergency rooms, or even (more generally) on ameliorative medicine, concentrating on endangered species (or other entities on the brink of extinction) will skew our definition of biodiversity.

Brilliant.

> Over the last five years a unified and comprehensive framework for this task has emerged though—to the best of my knowledge—it has never been fully and explicitly presented before. The major pieces have been developed in Australia and the United States, though contributions have also come from India, South Africa, and the United Kingdom (and, quite possibly, other places). The basic slogan, and this is as yet no more than a slogan, is the "adaptive management of landscapes.

A historical moment the 2002 —> a seemingly preventive-medicine approach to conservation biology. 

Science as Managment. Knowledge as the source by which Managment happens.

> The actual framework that has been developed is one for the prioriti- 9 zation of places for biodiversity value  and the formulation of management procedures for the long-term (in principle, infinite) survival of the biological units of interest.

the emergence of ‘value’ in conservation biology?

> At present "adaptive management" is only a slogan embodying a tantalizing promissory note.

> Talk of "place" takes us into intuitively trivial but, strangely, philosophically relatively uncharted territory. A place is geographically rooted and loses its sense of place exactly as it is generalized about: a place is a specific region on Earth's surface filled with the particular results of its individual history.

Another dimension that introduces vagueness into biodiveristy: locality.

> Philosophy—historically and, at least, the contemporary analytic tradition in Western philosophy"—has largely followed science in the deification of generality. Consequently places seem inappropriate loci of philosophical or scientific interest. Nevertheless, in the context of biodiversity conservation, we have to worry about the peculiarities of individual places, what entities they contain, what processes they admit, and what constrains those processes, all of which being subject to the contingencies of biological and geophysical history.

> Since, we have neither the economic nor the human resources to conserve every place of any biological interest—we would end up wanting to conserve Earth itself! Plans for conservation must ultimately involve a prioritization of places.

The need and reality for ‘prioritization’ is perhaps the origin of the idea of ‘conservation hotspots’.

> We must select some feature by which biodiversity may be estimated; such a feature is usually called a "surrogate" and the problem of choosing and estimating it is called the "surrogacy problem.

> Potential candidates as surrogates for biodiversity include the number of species or other biotic entities ("richness"), complexity of trophic webs, and so on.

> "place prioritization problem.

> (iii) Once we have a prioritized list of places on the basis of biodiversity content, we can proceed to assess the projected long-term future of 12 entities of interest in them; for instance, populations of species.

seems as the ‘species problem’ is a narrowed-down version of the ‘surrogate problem’ and the ‘place prioritization problem’.

> "viability problem."

> "feasibility problem."

> Ignoring people—or, worse, excluding them—is why many conservation fail miserably, most notably Project Tiger in India.

> What makes the definition of 'biodiversity' difficult is that the biological realm—entities and processes—is marked by variability at every level of complexity. Restricting attention to entities, two different hierarchical schemes are standardly used for biological classification:16 (i) a spatial (or generalized ecological) hierarchy starting from biological molecules and macromolecules, through cell organelles, cells, individuals, populations (demes) and meta-populations, communities, ecosystems (communities and their physical habitats) ultimately to the biosphere; and (ii) a taxonomic hierarchy from alleles through loci, linkage groups, genotypes, subspecies, species, genera, families, orders, classes, phyla and kingdoms.

people are always the last, even in this one.

> The most striking problem is the existence of "ring species."

the main problem of divising species according to the biological (fertile offspring) definition.

> Conserving biodiversity, and construing the term intuitively to refer to all the biological diversity that there is at every level of both hierarchies, amounts to saying that "biodiversity" refers to all biological entities. "Biodiversity" in effect becomes all of biology. Conservation would be an impractical proposal if "biodiversity" is construed in this way. The standard move at this stage is to suggest that three entities capture what is important about biodiversity: genes (alleles), species, and ecosystems. As a simplifying proposal in the face of intractable complexity, this convention has merit. If we conserve allelic heterogeneity completely, we take care of much of the diversity below the genotypic and individual levels of our two hierarchies. If we conserve all species, we do conserve all entities at higher levels of the taxonomic hierarchy though we may not conserve interspecific hybrids which, because of the leakage in our classificatory schema, may not qualify for conservation. If we conserve all ecosystems we may conserve many communities and so on, though this is hard to gauge: the highly fashionable term "ecosystem" is about the worst-defined in the ecological literature.

Famous quote of “‘biodiversity’ in effect becomes all of biology.”

Seems to evidence that despite being so many levels at which we can identify biolgoical diversity, it would not be useful or possible from a practical (conservation science-wise) point of view.

Thus, he reduces the diversity of biodiversity to three: genetic, species, and ecosystem.


> One bamboo species, Thrysostachys oliveri, flowered in Burma in 1891 and seeds were sent to Calcutta and Dehra Dun, about 1,500 km apart. Clumps raised at both these places flowered simultaneously in 1940. In 1961, there was simultaneous flowering of Muli bamboo (Melocanna baccifera) in Assam and Dehra Dun, about 1,500 km apart. In 1970-71, there was simultaneous flowering of spiny bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea) throughout India after a lapse of 45 years. Clearly, a very precise biological clock exists in these species. In these cases, extinction of the species would also lead to the extinction of the phenomenon of synchronous flowering. More interesting, in this context, is that in extended habitats consisting of forests of a single bamboo species, flowering occurs in waves, starting at one end and ending up at the other. This is the phenomenon that would disappear if these habitats do, even if the species persisted elsewhere (for instance, as isolated stands in botanical gardens). Protecting the holy trinity of genes, species and ecosystems will typically not save such phenomena. The examples given above clearly show why conserving species and, thus, the genes within them, will not be sufficient.

Epiphenomena as a source of biodiversity as well.

> The question is whether we can devise a definition of "biodiversity" that will lead to the protection of endangered and other biological phenomena of interest, along with all other components of biodiversity. The proposals put forth in this paper will not provide an adequate solution to this problem.

this is his aim.

I am still unsure about how “phenomena of interest” is defined. How is value given?


> If a definition of 'biodiversity' is to have any practical application, two problems must be solved: (i) a relatively theoretical one, what is to be measured?; 25 and (ii) a practical one, can we realistically obtain the data that we want? the former is the problem of quantification; the latter is the problem of estimation. Jointly, these two problems comprise the problem of assessing biodiversity. To solve both problems requires choices of surrogates.

From the beginning, theoretical and practical are separated, as if these were two distinct problems.

> To solve the quantification problem, we will have to use surrogates that serve as indicators of general biodiversity.

> True surrogates are supposed to represent general biodiversity, that is, the target variable is supposed to be general biodiversity. The only constraint on a true surrogate is that, in principle, it should be amenable to sufficient quantification to allow its estimation in the field, even if only with difficulty. Thus, once we decide on a true surrogate, we have solved the problem of quantification to the extent that we require. The trouble, of course, is that because we do not know what general biodiversity is, we will never be able to assert beyond controversy that we have found the true surrogate. Worse, empirical considerations alone will not allow.

The main problem: what is ‘GENERAL’ biodiversity?

> complete solution of this problem because of the indeterminacy of 'biodiversity': empirical arguments can only settle questions about relations between empirically well-specified entities. Conventions will enter into any determination of true surrogacy and these conventions will have to be justified. The justification will be based on both practical and apparently theoretical considerations.

> Consider four common—and plausible—candidates:
> **(i) Character or trait diversity**: the intuition behind this is that evolutionary mechanisms usually impinge directly on traits of individuals in populations. [...] The trouble is that 'trait' is not a technical term within biology and trait diversity is, therefore, not precise enough to solve the quantification problem adequately; [...] 
> **(ii) Species diversity**: [...] it is important to note that species are the most well-defined category above the genotype in the taxonomic hierarchy and, because of that, the intuition that species diversity is a good true surrogate has some theoretical merit. There are two problems: (a) compiling a list of all species [...] (b) we know very well that there is much more to biodiversity than species diversity; 
> **(iii) Life-zone diversity**: this reflects the intuitions that (a) what is important is the variety of biotic communities with their associated patterns of interactions. [...] Life-zone classification provides a partial way out: it involves coupling the characteristics of some communities in a place, in particular vegetation, with environmental parameters such as elevation, precipitation and temperature (and, sometimes, soil types). For many areas of the world, fairly precise life zone classifications exist, for instance, the Holridge (1967) classification for central America and Oshawa (1987) for the Bhutan Himalaya.
> **(iv) Environmental parameter diversity**: the most theoreticallyjustified intuition behind this is that each point of the space spanned by environmental parameters is a putative niche to be occupied by some species.

à la Darwin “economy of nature”: well-defined place in environment that ‘demands’ a given adaptation.

> There is no fully non-conventional solution to the true surrogacy problem. To choose any of these four candidates—or any other—will require the use of pragmatic criteria, in other words, the adoption of some convention.

One of the most important takes.

The only way to escape the representation problem is the introduction of a social convention —> that is precisely one of the main teachings of the history of science.

> Two of our candidates have obvious disadvantages: as noted before, character diversity is too imprecise. It cannot be quantified even to the extent required to judge the adequacy of estimator-surrogates for it; environmental-parameter diversity, besides having the other problems mentioned above, is also intuitively unappealing simply because it is manifestly non-biological—at best it is a plausible candidate for estimatorsurrogacy. Our other two candidates—species and life-zone diversity— remain plausible. Note that nothing requires us to have only one true surrogate and it seems reasonable to use both. Moreover, none of the candidates addresses the issue of endangered biological phenomena. This can simply be added to the other two. This seems ad hoc, and there seems to be no way out. It makes more sense to try to protect places that are critical for the persistence of endangered biological phenomena while prioritizing places (as described in Section 4).

Main dissadvantages and decision on which surrogate candidates are to be chosen: character and environmental-parameter diversity gone (interesting to see the reason for the latter: not biology enough, disciplinary-boundary making?): species and life-zone diversity.

> In contrast to true surrogates, estimator-surrogates have a true surrogate as the target variable.

the next step —> from true surrogates (semi-theoretical construct) to estimator-surrogate (empirically attainable).

BIODIVERSITY (THEORY, CONCEPT) <> TRUE SURROGATE (SEMI-THEORY) <> ESTIMATOR-SURROGATE (EMPIRICAL)

> relation that must be investigated through field work.

> Moreover —and this is a point that cannot be over-emphasized—it is an empirical 26 What has to be shown is that there is a good—preferably (but unachievably) perfect— method to predict true surrogate diversity using the estimator-surrogates.

> Traditionally, the estimator-surrogate that has been the most popular is species richness, the number of species at a place, which is distinct from species diversity. (Returning to the example from the last paragraph, communities X and Y have the same species richness [namely, 2] though X is more diverse than Y.

TWO POINTS.

1. Contrary to a note above - focus in species richness has not been due to a narrowing down of the conceptualisation of biodiveristy. It seems that at this point (2002), species diversity was already a measure of biodiversity

2. What is the difference between species richness and species diversity?Richness: simply the number, species diversity: the ratio of individuals? (which brings about the question of ratio of what?).

> Gaston (1996) lists five lines of evidence that point to species richness as a good estimator-surrogate for biodiversity: (i) species richness can be correlated to many measures of ecological diversity and it functions better in this way than most estimator-surrogates, including species diversity (see, also, Magurran [1988]); (ii) species richness is sometimes positively correlated with the number of higher taxa such as genera; (iii) when species richness is relatively high, it is correlated with trait richness; (iv) though this remains controversial, some parameters that are supposed to measure the complexity of community webs (including the number of edges and the length of directed paths along trophic levels) seem to be correlated with species richness; (v) relatively high species richness is also correlated with increasing topographic diversity.

> There are, moreover, two strong arguments against using species richness, or, for that matter, richness of any estimator-surrogates to prioritize places.

> The top two (or more) places may be rich in the targeted surrogates but may have very similar surrogates. Conserving both may add nothing, or very little, to what would be obtained by conserving one and some other place. Conserving both would thus be an ineffective allocation of limited resources; and (ii) the reason why selecting places on the basis of richness is ineffective is that, even intuitively, richness is not the same as diversity.

Complex argumentation, including desiderata from the practical aims of conservation biology.

> There are at least seven more plausible candidates for estimator-surrogates.

he rejects species richness as an estimator surrogate of species diversity.

> (i) environmental parameter composition
> (ii) soil-type composition
> (iii) dominant-vegetation composition
> (iv) species composition
> (v) life zone composition
> (vi) genus or other higher-taxon composition
> (vii) subsets of species composition

> If species diversity is taken to be the (only) true surrogate, the adequacy of the first of these four (species composition) is obviously trivially guaranteed; for any of the other true surrogates the problem of determining its empirical surrogacy remains.

Reading this really gives the feeling that a lot is happening in the field of conservation biology: things are moving and the knowledge seems unstable. Perhaps worth checking what happened around this time (turn of the century)

> trying to use total species composition as an estimatorsurrogate is unjustified for the simple reason that it cannot be assessed rapidly and easily, as is required for such surrogates

He knows explicitly argues that surrogate estimators must be practical to assess (rapid and easy estimation), adding on to the inherent practical mindset of conservation biologists.

> There is no reason to believe that the same estimator-surrogates will be the best ones for all regions. But mat is not necessary so long as the ones that are used are shown to be adequate for the context of their use.

And very important! He doesn’t argue for global measures of biodiveristy, but context-specific, expecting that they will be local and not work everywhere! VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT!

> At this stage, what we have in hand are a set of places and list of surrogates at each place. We now have to prioritize these places and the prioritization procedure will implicitly define what 'biodiversity' is taken to be. But, to prioritize places in this fashion—and this is a critical point— we need no absolute concept or measure of biodiversity. We merely need to be able to decide whether place A has greater biodiversity than place B.

Developed thoughts as above.

> Biodiversity will be relativized in two ways: (i) the definition will only try to say if place A has higher (or the same or lower) biodiversity than B; and (ii) it will do so only against a background set of places 11

**KEY**:
Biodiversity as a context-dependent measure to establish political priorities of conservation, not a global nor objective (as in non-human independent) measurement.

> Different concepts of biodiversity are implicitly defined by these algorithms: biodiversity is the relation used to prioritize places.

THIS! 

> The crucial rule is complementarity: by focusing on new surrogates it naturally captures our intuition of biodiversity. With some rhetorical flourish we may just as well say that what matters is complementarity: the concept of biodiversity is parasitic on the concept of complementarity.

Don’t really understand what complementarity means here but then again, I have skimread the previous pages on the calculating algorhythm.

> Recall that our context is one of biological conservation. We want to protect what is threatened by extinction: by and 36 large, rarity captures that intuition.

> Finally, it is important to note two points about these algorithms: (i) they operate on lists of surrogates for each space. We cannot compound these lists into single numbers—such as richness or MacArthur's diversity index—and continue to use these algorithms. Field work generally involves compiling such lists. Yet, it is common practice among field biologists to reduce these lists to single numbers (or small sets of numbers) and discard the primary data. The proposals being made in this paper about the definition and assessment of biodiversity argue strongly against this practice; and (ii) these algorithms show very strong history-dependence. Which places we start with and the order in which the rules are.

Key passage but complex: relationship between black-boxing scientific practices, historical- and context-dependent listing of conservation priorities, and sociopolitical attentivness. 

I don’t really understand it, needs a re-read.

> applied make a very significant difference on the priority ordering of the set of places we work with. Consequently, if we introduce a cut-off above which we conserve places and below which we do not, the set of places targeted for conservation is similarly history-dependent. While this initially appears to be a problem—or at least an undesirable feature—of our procedure, in some contexts we can convert it into a virtue. For instance, suppose that we have sociopolitical constraints that we must also try to satisfy while recommending a set of places for conservation (that is, a reserve network of some sort or other). We can initialize our procedure by choosing the first place differently and generate different sets of potentially conserved places which equally satisfy our biodiversity criteria. Then we can opt for the one that best satisfies our sociopolitical criteria.

> the solution points to empirical work that must be done, not solely for philosophical reasons, but for the practical goal of successfully conserving biodiversity. The empirical work that is critical in this manner is the identification of adequate estimator-surrogates. To the extent that philosophical analysis has had this practical scientific consequence—and one that has unfortunately not received adequate attention within science—it underscores the importance of philosophy for science.

Philosophy of science has worked here to point to **what** empirical content one must look at.

> (i) The most interesting facet of this solution to the definition and assessment problems for biodiversity is that it was only possible because of contextualization. We determined what 'biodiversity' is by exploring what it was supposed to accomplish, and supposed to do so in the very specific and historically contingent context of the deterioration of our biological legacy during the past half-century. The rationale for this move was that this was the context in which the term 'biodiversity' was introduced and gained currency.

ending of the paper with reference to antnrhopogenic environmental effects, and the disciplinary indebtedness of conservation biology to it.
