# biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation
#conceptnote 

The idea is quite obvious when looking at the historical actors themselves. In [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) (p. 38) we see that Dan Janzen, one of the attendees of the [1986 National Forum on BioDiversity](·%20%20biodiv--a%20rough%20list%20of%20events.md#1986%20National%20Forum%20on%20BioDiversity), recalls that event as "an explicit political event, explicitly designed to make Congresss aware of this complexity of species that we're losing."

## Some clarifications
### What do I mean by 'analytic concept'?
- Analysis understood as a value-free descriptive tool, here refering grossly to 'science'. See [the value of 'biodiversity' is not given by science](the%20value%20of%20'biodiversity'%20is%20not%20given%20by%20science.md).

### What do I mean by 'political'?
- 'Political' both as understdood by the historical actors themselves (see below, Janzen) and as an analytic category ('politics' as the practice of managing resources for and in a population)
