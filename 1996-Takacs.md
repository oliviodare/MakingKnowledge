## Reading notes


> I had originally planned to provide a thoroughgoing history of the evolution of the concept of biodiversity, along with a comprehensive history of biologists advocating conservation. This project would have taken me well into my retirement years; neither my common sense nor my funding sources thought this advisable. Suffice it to say thtat Chapter 2 ['The Making of Biodiveristy'] might provide grist for several other books, none of which I plan to write. (p. xii)

There's my excuse/reason for my research and 'knowledge gap' I can tackle!

> Part of the point of this work is that it is difficult to distinguish biodiversity, a socially constructed idea, from biodiversity, some concrete phenomenon. My editors ask that I put *biodiversity* and its closer relative, *nature*, in italics whenver I discuss these words without direct reference to the outside world to which these terms relate. But the terms are always informed by that tanglible world [**Takacs not a relativist, nor strong constructivist**]; and we have no direct access to that world without our conceptual process [**Takacs not a naïve realist**]. The decesion whether to italicize has come down to a coin flip in a few cases. I believe any confusion this creates will encourage you to ponder the flexible boundaries between the real world and our depictions of it. (p. xvi)


> *[B]iodiversity* is used to shape public perceptions of, feelings about, and actions towards that world. Biologist hope to have a say in forging a new ethics, new moral codes, even new faiths. By staking out new sources of power for themselves, they ultimately hope to gain control over nature–over how and where and even why wild organisms and natural processes are allowed to endure. (p. 2) [and most visibly (p. 3)] Scientists who love the natural world forged the term *biodiversity* as a weapon to be wielded in these battles [over biological resources, between wealthy and poor humans].

I see a parallel with the argument in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md) about the rise of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility), as a set of values, practices, representations aimed at dealing with and managing extinction and preserving biodiversity. They both make the emphasis in the mental dimension of such social processes (the 'endangerment sensibility'). 

The quote from page 3 ("scientists who love") is later elaborated on, as a "contradiction in terms" representing the (new) ethos and epistemic virtues that conservation biologists represent. 

> Biodiversity is a formidable constituency; its representatives wield significant power in a society that cares to preserve it. Biologists, who have been called upon to provide "facts" about the natural world, now clear space to speak of nature's "values". That they should be experts  on all aspects of the natural world is sometimes disputed by politicians, religious folk, economits, corporate executives, citizens whose land rights are jeopardized, indigenous people who claim to be guardians of knowledge about and protects of biodiversity, and a host of other constitutencies who have a stake in nature. Tensions are guaranteed to arise thourgh this struggle to speak for nature. (p. 5)

One of the main topics in studying the HPS/STS of biodiversity: how is the power to manage the crisis given to scientists? what other social actors are involved in addressing the biodiversity crisis, or are 'affected' by scientists framing the crisis as such?
