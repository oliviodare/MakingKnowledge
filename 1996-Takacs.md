## Reading notes

### Chapter 1. 'Tensions at the crossroads of science, nature, & conservation'

> I had originally planned to provide a thoroughgoing history of the evolution of the concept of biodiversity, along with a comprehensive history of biologists advocating conservation. This project would have taken me well into my retirement years; neither my common sense nor my funding sources thought this advisable. Suffice it to say thtat Chapter 2 ['The Making of Biodiveristy'] might provide grist for several other books, none of which I plan to write. (p. xii)

There's my excuse/reason for my research and 'knowledge gap' I can tackle!

> Part of the point of this work is that it is difficult to distinguish biodiversity, a socially constructed idea, from biodiversity, some concrete phenomenon. My editors ask that I put *biodiversity* and its closer relative, *nature*, in italics whenver I discuss these words without direct reference to the outside world to which these terms relate. But the terms are always informed by that tanglible world [**Takacs not a relativist, nor strong constructivist**]; and we have no direct access to that world without our conceptual process [**Takacs not a naïve realist**]. The decesion whether to italicize has come down to a coin flip in a few cases. I believe any confusion this creates will encourage you to ponder the flexible boundaries between the real world and our depictions of it. (p. xvi)


> *[B]iodiversity* is used to shape public perceptions of, feelings about, and actions towards that world. Biologist hope to have a say in forging a new ethics, new moral codes, even new faiths. By staking out new sources of power for themselves, they ultimately hope to gain control over nature–over how and where and even why wild organisms and natural processes are allowed to endure. (p. 2) [and most visibly (p. 3)] Scientists who love the natural world forged the term *biodiversity* as a weapon to be wielded in these battles [over biological resources, between wealthy and poor humans].

I see a parallel with the argument in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md) about the rise of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility), as a set of values, practices, representations aimed at dealing with and managing extinction and preserving biodiversity. They both make the emphasis in the mental dimension of such social processes (the 'endangerment sensibility'). 

The quote from page 3 ("scientists who love") is later elaborated on, as a "contradiction in terms" representing the (new) ethos and epistemic virtues that conservation biologists represent. 

> Biodiversity is a formidable constituency; its representatives wield significant power in a society that cares to preserve it. Biologists, who have been called upon to provide "facts" about the natural world, now clear space to speak of nature's "values". That they should be experts  on all aspects of the natural world is sometimes disputed by politicians, religious folk, economits, corporate executives, citizens whose land rights are jeopardized, indigenous people who claim to be guardians of knowledge about and protects of biodiversity, and a host of other constitutencies who have a stake in nature. Tensions are guaranteed to arise thourgh this struggle to speak for nature. (p. 5)

One of the main topics in studying the HPS/STS of biodiversity: how is the power to manage the crisis given to scientists? what other social actors are involved in addressing the biodiversity crisis, or are 'affected' by scientists framing the crisis as such?

> Around the time the term _biodiversity_ made its appearance, another shibboleth, _sustainable development_, was also gaining clout. In graduate school, I earned an official minor in conservation and sustainable development. Contemplate this for a moment and you see another tension: how can we simultaneously conserve and develop? The growing needs of a growing population would seem to clash with the neeeds of those who want unsullied natural refugia. Thses forces classh in titanic battles over economic development, social justice, and long-term survival.<sup>1 [endnote referring to literature on the tension between 'development' and 'biodiversity']</sup> (p. 5)

The topic of 'sustainable development' is important and has a history too, and parallel to that of 'conservation' and 'biodiversity', [I need to deal with the relation betweeen 'biodiversity' and 'sustainable development'](I%20need%20to%20deal%20with%20the%20relation%20betweeen%20'biodiversity'%20and%20'sustainable%20development'.md).


### Chapter 2. 'The making of biodiversity'

> [W]hen considering the rise to prominence of the term *biodiversity*, we may consider four timelines: 
> 1. biologists' ideas of biological diversity;
> 2. biologists' promotion of biological diversity to the public;
> 3. the public's actions and values vis-à-vis biological diversity;
> 4. and changes in diversity itself. 
> 
> Events along each timeline affect and constrain the others. 

This structure that Takacs proposes may be useful in doing a multilayered, 'social network analysis' *à la* [2020b-Renn](2020b-Renn.md), as [social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md). 

In this case, there seems to be a *partial* mapping of Renns' and Takac's categories, althought Takac's are more broad (they fall under different analytical categories of epistemic networks)
1. "biologists' ideas of biological diversity" is part of the **semantic dimension** of the epistemic network.
2. "biologists' promotion of biological diversity to the public" is part of the **social dimension** of the epistemic network.
3. "the public's actions and values vis-à-vis biological diversity" is part of the **social and semantic dimensions** of the epistemic network.
4. "changes in diversity itself" is part of the **semiotic dimension** of the epistemic network. 


**Aldo Leopold (1887–1948)**

![Aldo | 300](https://baynature.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Aldo-Leopold-photo_2.jpg)

> Aldo Leopold (1887-1948) was a forester, game manager, wild-life ecologist, hunter, philosopher, and writer.<sup>5</sup> Prominent environmental historians and philosophers have mined Leopold's writings, which offer a rich lode for (sometimes contradictory) exegesis.<sup>6</sup> (p. 11)

One of his most well-known works: *A Sand County Almanac*. 

> When we examine the public defense of biodiversity by today's conservation biologists, we find tghat Leopold was often there first. He writes of restoration ecology. He recognizes the connections between cultural and biological diversity. He sees that economic valuations of biological species are often cheap rationalizations, yet he nonetheless presents nature as a multifarious resource for humankind.<sup>10</sup>(p. 12)

I am curious about the similarities and tensions between"economic valuations" and "nature as a mutlifarious resource": [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md)

> He [Leopold] cites as a rationale for conservation "the tacit **evidence** of evolution, in which diversity and stability are so closely intertwined as to seem to names for one fact." Leopold observes that "science has given us many doubts, but it has given us at least one certainty: the trend of evolution is to elaborate and diversify the biota."
> 
> Herein lies the problem with **relying on scientific facts** for the tenets of an **environmental ethic**: science is sometimes wrong. The facts of ecology and evolution on which to base this ethic may turn out to be the wishes of the ethic makers. The ecological theory that correlates species diversity with ecological stability seems to have been widely violated. Leopold's "one certainty" of science has been recently made somewhat less certain, if we accept Stephen Jay Gould's contention that the "cone of diversity" is just another ecological myth, and that evolution produced its maximum diversity over 500 million years ago.

Here is one of the tensions of environmental ethics: [relying on scientific facts to develop an ethic is problematic](relying%20on%20scientific%20facts%20to%20develop%20an%20ethic%20is%20problematic.md).
