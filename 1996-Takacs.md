## Reading notes

### Chapter 1. 'Tensions at the crossroads of science, nature, & conservation'

> I had originally planned to provide a thoroughgoing history of the evolution of the concept of biodiversity, along with a comprehensive history of biologists advocating conservation. This project would have taken me well into my retirement years; neither my common sense nor my funding sources thought this advisable. Suffice it to say thtat Chapter 2 ['The Making of Biodiveristy'] might provide grist for several other books, none of which I plan to write. (p. xii)

There's my excuse/reason for my research and 'knowledge gap' I can tackle!

> Part of the point of this work is that it is difficult to distinguish biodiversity, a socially constructed idea, from biodiversity, some concrete phenomenon. My editors ask that I put *biodiversity* and its closer relative, *nature*, in italics whenver I discuss these words without direct reference to the outside world to which these terms relate. But the terms are always informed by that tanglible world [**Takacs not a relativist, nor strong constructivist**]; and we have no direct access to that world without our conceptual process [**Takacs not a naïve realist**]. The decesion whether to italicize has come down to a coin flip in a few cases. I believe any confusion this creates will encourage you to ponder the flexible boundaries between the real world and our depictions of it. (p. xvi)


> *[B]iodiversity* is used to shape public perceptions of, feelings about, and actions towards that world. Biologist hope to have a say in forging a new ethics, new moral codes, even new faiths. By staking out new sources of power for themselves, they ultimately hope to gain control over nature–over how and where and even why wild organisms and natural processes are allowed to endure. (p. 2) [and most visibly (p. 3)] Scientists who love the natural world forged the term *biodiversity* as a weapon to be wielded in these battles [over biological resources, between wealthy and poor humans].

I see a parallel with the argument in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md) about the rise of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility), as a set of values, practices, representations aimed at dealing with and managing extinction and preserving biodiversity. They both make the emphasis in the mental dimension of such social processes (the 'endangerment sensibility'). 

The quote from page 3 ("scientists who love") is later elaborated on, as a "contradiction in terms" representing the (new) ethos and epistemic virtues that conservation biologists represent. 

> Biodiversity is a formidable constituency; its representatives wield significant power in a society that cares to preserve it. Biologists, who have been called upon to provide "facts" about the natural world, now clear space to speak of nature's "values". That they should be experts  on all aspects of the natural world is sometimes disputed by politicians, religious folk, economits, corporate executives, citizens whose land rights are jeopardized, indigenous people who claim to be guardians of knowledge about and protects of biodiversity, and a host of other constitutencies who have a stake in nature. Tensions are guaranteed to arise thourgh this struggle to speak for nature. (p. 5)

One of the main topics in studying the HPS/STS of biodiversity: how is the power to manage the crisis given to scientists? what other social actors are involved in addressing the biodiversity crisis, or are 'affected' by scientists framing the crisis as such?

> Around the time the term _biodiversity_ made its appearance, another shibboleth, _sustainable development_, was also gaining clout. In graduate school, I earned an official minor in conservation and sustainable development. Contemplate this for a moment and you see another tension: how can we simultaneously conserve and develop? The growing needs of a growing population would seem to clash with the neeeds of those who want unsullied natural refugia. Thses forces classh in titanic battles over economic development, social justice, and long-term survival.<sup>1 [endnote referring to literature on the tension between 'development' and 'biodiversity']</sup> (p. 5)

The topic of 'sustainable development' is important and has a history too, and parallel to that of 'conservation' and 'biodiversity', [I need to deal with the relation betweeen 'biodiversity' and 'sustainable development'](I%20need%20to%20deal%20with%20the%20relation%20betweeen%20'biodiversity'%20and%20'sustainable%20development'.md).


### Chapter 2. 'The making of biodiversity'

> [W]hen considering the rise to prominence of the term *biodiversity*, we may consider four timelines: 
> 1. biologists' ideas of biological diversity;
> 2. biologists' promotion of biological diversity to the public;
> 3. the public's actions and values vis-à-vis biological diversity;
> 4. and changes in diversity itself. 
> 
> Events along each timeline affect and constrain the others. 

This structure that Takacs proposes may be useful in doing a multilayered, 'social network analysis' *à la* [2020b-Renn](2020b-Renn.md), as [social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md). 

In this case, there seems to be a *partial* mapping of Renns' and Takac's categories, althought Takac's are more broad (they fall under different analytical categories of epistemic networks)
1. "biologists' ideas of biological diversity" is part of the **semantic dimension** of the epistemic network.
2. "biologists' promotion of biological diversity to the public" is part of the **social dimension** of the epistemic network.
3. "the public's actions and values vis-à-vis biological diversity" is part of the **social and semantic dimensions** of the epistemic network.
4. "changes in diversity itself" is part of the **semiotic dimension** of the epistemic network. 


Now, Takacs goes on to describe the work of several men (and a woman) in the history of the making of *biodiversity*.

#### Aldo Leopold (1887–1948)

![Aldo | 300](https://baynature.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Aldo-Leopold-photo_2.jpg)

> Aldo Leopold (1887-1948) was a forester, game manager, wild-life ecologist, hunter, philosopher, and writer.<sup>5</sup> Prominent environmental historians and philosophers have mined Leopold's writings, which offer a rich lode for (sometimes contradictory) exegesis.<sup>6</sup> (p. 11)

One of his most well-known works: *A Sand County Almanac*. 

> When we examine the public defense of biodiversity by today's conservation biologists, we find that Leopold was often there first. He writes of restoration ecology. He recognizes the connections between cultural and biological diversity. He sees that economic valuations of biological species are often cheap rationalizations, yet he nonetheless presents nature as a multifarious resource for humankind.<sup>10</sup>(p. 12)

I am curious about the similarities and tensions between"economic valuations" and "nature as a mutlifarious resource": [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md)

> He [Leopold] cites as a rationale for conservation "the tacit **evidence** of evolution, in which diversity and stability are so closely intertwined as to seem to names for one fact." Leopold observes that "science has given us many doubts, but it has given us at least one certainty: the trend of evolution is to elaborate and diversify the biota."
> 
> Herein lies the problem with **relying on scientific facts** for the tenets of an **environmental ethic**: science is sometimes wrong. The facts of ecology and evolution on which to base this ethic may turn out to be the wishes of the ethic makers. The ecological theory that correlates species diversity with ecological stability seems to have been widely violated. Leopold's "one certainty" of science has been recently made somewhat less certain, if we accept Stephen Jay Gould's contention that the "cone of diversity" is just another ecological myth, and that evolution produced its maximum diversity over 500 million years ago. (p. 15)
> [...]
> How can one ever extricate what the natural world really tells us from what we wish the natural world told us? Years after Leopold's death, the creators of the term *biodiversity* would come to recognize the skien of human desires wrapped around nature. They, like Leopold before them, would derive a set of values from ecological science, just as they have derived facts. Both facts and valuers are open to debate; both lie within the ecologists' ambit. (p. 15)

Here is one of the tensions of environmental ethics: [relying on scientific facts to develop an ethic is problematic](relying%20on%20scientific%20facts%20to%20develop%20an%20ethic%20is%20problematic.md).

> Leopold presents nature as a resource for people in part because to do otherwise would be hypocrisy. The land serves us by rpoviding the basis for agriculture, meat to fill bodily cravings, beauty to satisfy our aesthetic cravings, experinces to fill our need for adventure, and moral lessons to help us live ethical lives. Biological diversity provides a diversity of functions for humans; even in protecting it and mourning its loss, we learna lesson about what it means to be fully human.<sup>25</sup> (p. 16)

This contributes to the understanding of [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md), seeing how Leopold's understanding of 'use' and 'pragmatism' was inclusive and was not reduced to economic value. 

#### Charles S. Elton (1900–1992)

![Elton | 300](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZcjyTpXcAAq28d.jpg)

> In tracing the arcadian and imperial strands of ecology's history, Donald Worster casts British ecologists Charles S. Elton (1900–1992) as something of a villain: Elton led twentieth-century ecolgoy down the less desired "imperial" path, paving the way for a public conception of nature calculated in unappealing economic figures snd measured by energy meters.<sup>38</sup> Categories Worster presents as dichotomous may in fact be interpenetrating: Leopold took Elton's ecological systems and biotic pyramids and made them fundamentals in his land ethic. And when Elton began to tackle conservation, he had clearly been influenced by *A Sand County Almanac*. (p. 22)

This further helps understand [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md), and seeing how, in fact, they are have been historically co-constructed. 

> Elton's final chapter [in *The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants*], "The Conservation of Variety", reveals his ecologist's slant on the world. He is not concerned with individual species, so much the fouc of conservation efforts then and later. Rather, he is interest in a forerunner of biodiversity, "ecological variety", which he treats as a concrete entity requiring our concern and protection. What counts is the dynamics of the ecological community, the innumerable complex interactions that keep systems stable. The ideal state of nature is diverse wilderness, epitomized by the tropic rain forest. 
> [...] 
> Balance, stability, richness, diversity, and complexity: these qualities good in human communities are said to be good in ecological communties, too. [...] It would be several decades after Elton before ecologists would suggest that it's a jungle out there: balance has been superseded by chaos. (p. 24)

Here we see how Elton contributes to the [mid-20th century movements of revaluing diversity, where 'biodiversity' became a normative concept and a "vital resource" for mankind](from%20the%20mid-20c%20'biodiversity'%20became%20a%20normative%20concept%20and%20a%20"vital%20resource"%20for%20mankind.md). 

> Elton's conservation ethic in *Invasions* aims at practical ends that are both ambitious and modest. He was a political scientist: he helped form the British Nature Conservancy and then used it to lobby for conservation goals. (p. 24)
> [...]
> *The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants* attempts to change established attitudes, to forge new ethics. As a pragmatist, Elton consigned wilderness to the patron saint of lost causes. He was willing, instead, to settle for the preservation or re-creation fo remnant scraps of ecological variety in the managed landscape. Ecology provides the scientific facts and the scientific fears that will prompt other to see the **desirability** of his prescriptions [...] He sought to put his decades of scientific research to work to change the way people viewed the landscape, so that they would change the landscape that they viewed. (p. 25)


Elton's views were also highly pragmatic, contributing to the evidence that. [there has been a movement towards pragmatism in the history of environmentalism](there%20has%20been%20a%20movement%20towards%20pragmatism%20in%20the%20history%20of%20environmentalism.md).


#### Rachel Carson (1907–64)

![Carson | 300](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freshvista.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2FRachelCarson.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

> Wildlife biologist and best-selling author Rachel Carson (1907–64) also used ecological science to change the way we see and feel. Her early works focused on the wonders of nature in general and the marine environments in particular. By her indelibre descriptions, she wished her readers to see what she saw and feelw what she felt. In *Silent Spring* (1962), she channeled Elton's ecological ideas towards a more potent and political end than he did.<sup>50</sup> *Silent Spring* documents the terrifying threat uncontrolled use of pesticides posed to nature's beauty and human health–a world threat that could be overcome only by a thoroughly ecological worldview. (p. 26)


> In *Silent Spring*, **scientist are the enemies** who have begotten the chemicals that beget death and destruction: "The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modern and terrible **weapons**, and that in turning them against the insects it has also tunred them against the earth."<sup>53</sup> But **scientists are also the sources of salvation**, creating alternatives to those chemicals and revealing hitherto obscure interrelationships within nature and human relationships with anture. For Carson, **ecologists repay the debt of science to society** by forging a worldview for us all to adopt so that we may, before it is too late, come to appreciate the services natural variety performs for us. (p. 26)

Carson and her book *Silent Spring* is one of the forerunners of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility) in the 20th century. In this section, we see the double-edge sword of science: both the creator of the destruction and the possibility for salvation. Pesticides, as a scientific invention by the chemical industries is opposed by the mission of ecologists, who in Takac's account of Carson's view, can "repay the debt of science to society." (p. 27). This double-edge sword contributes to the question of [what is the late-modern concept of 'reflexivity'?](what%20is%20the%20late-modern%20concept%20of%20'reflexivity'?.md).


#### David Ehrenfeld

![Ehrenfeld | 300](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwhitepineprograms.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2FJoan-and-David-300x300.png&f=1&nofb=1)

> During the 1960s and 1970s, the growing reification of diversity kept pace with perceived threats to the natural reality to which the term referred. [...] During the 1970s, David Ehrenfeld promoted the role of the biologist as "advocate for the natural world" in two books, *Conserving Life on Earth* (1972) and *The Arrogance of Humanism* (1978). Ehrenfeld (who has a medical degree and earned a doctorate studying sea turtles) sought simulatneously to bring the ecological perspective to a broad audience, ato promote nonanthropocentric reasons for diversity conservation, and to get as many people as possible to experience nature for themselves, so that they would not need a host of convoluted rationalizations to become convinced of the values of biological diversity (p. 30)
