**Take-home message**: It describes how biologists attempted to shape new ideas about nature by using a new concept - 'biodiversity', and in turn, shape how humans relate to natural environments. "This book [...] is about the dialectic between biodiversity, the notional totality of life on this planet, and *biodiversity*, the term biologists have concocted as an approximation for that totality: a scientized synonym for *nature*, imbued with the values biologists cherish." (p. 106)

### Chapter 1. 'Tensions at the crossroads of science, nature, & conservation'

> I had originally planned to provide a thoroughgoing history of the evolution of the concept of biodiversity, along with a comprehensive history of biologists advocating conservation. This project would have taken me well into my retirement years; neither my common sense nor my funding sources thought this advisable. Suffice it to say thtat Chapter 2 ['The Making of Biodiveristy'] might provide grist for several other books, none of which I plan to write. (p. xii)

There's my excuse/reason for my research and 'knowledge gap' I can tackle!

> Part of the point of this work is that it is difficult to distinguish biodiversity, a socially constructed idea, from biodiversity, some concrete phenomenon. My editors ask that I put *biodiversity* and its closer relative, *nature*, in italics whenver I discuss these words without direct reference to the outside world to which these terms relate. But the terms are always informed by that tanglible world [**Takacs not a relativist, nor strong constructivist**]; and we have no direct access to that world without our conceptual process [**Takacs not a naïve realist**]. The decesion whether to italicize has come down to a coin flip in a few cases. I believe any confusion this creates will encourage you to ponder the flexible boundaries between the real world and our depictions of it. (p. xvi)


> *[B]iodiversity* is used to shape public perceptions of, feelings about, and actions towards that world. Biologist hope to have a say in forging a new ethics, new moral codes, even new faiths. By staking out new sources of power for themselves, they ultimately hope to gain control over nature–over how and where and even why wild organisms and natural processes are allowed to endure. (p. 2) [and most visibly (p. 3)] Scientists who love the natural world forged the term *biodiversity* as a weapon to be wielded in these battles [over biological resources, between wealthy and poor humans].

I see a parallel with the argument in [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md) about the rise of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility), as a set of values, practices, representations aimed at dealing with and managing extinction and preserving biodiversity. They both make the emphasis in the mental dimension of such social processes (the 'endangerment sensibility'). 

The quote from page 3 ("scientists who love") is later elaborated on, as a "contradiction in terms" representing the (new) ethos and epistemic virtues that conservation biologists represent. 

> Biodiversity is a formidable constituency; its representatives wield significant power in a society that cares to preserve it. Biologists, who have been called upon to provide "facts" about the natural world, now clear space to speak of nature's "values". That they should be experts  on all aspects of the natural world is sometimes disputed by politicians, religious folk, economits, corporate executives, citizens whose land rights are jeopardized, indigenous people who claim to be guardians of knowledge about and protects of biodiversity, and a host of other constitutencies who have a stake in nature. Tensions are guaranteed to arise thourgh this struggle to speak for nature. (p. 5)

One of the main topics in studying the HPS/STS of biodiversity: how is the power to manage the crisis given to scientists? what other social actors are involved in addressing the biodiversity crisis, or are 'affected' by scientists framing the crisis as such?

> Around the time the term _biodiversity_ made its appearance, another shibboleth, _sustainable development_, was also gaining clout. In graduate school, I earned an official minor in conservation and sustainable development. Contemplate this for a moment and you see another tension: how can we simultaneously conserve and develop? The growing needs of a growing population would seem to clash with the neeeds of those who want unsullied natural refugia. Thses forces classh in titanic battles over economic development, social justice, and long-term survival.<sup>1 [endnote referring to literature on the tension between 'development' and 'biodiversity']</sup> (p. 5)

The topic of 'sustainable development' is important and has a history too, and parallel to that of 'conservation' and 'biodiversity', [I need to deal with the relation betweeen 'biodiversity' and 'sustainable development'](I%20need%20to%20deal%20with%20the%20relation%20betweeen%20'biodiversity'%20and%20'sustainable%20development'.md).


### Chapter 2. 'The making of biodiversity'

> [W]hen considering the rise to prominence of the term *biodiversity*, we may consider four timelines: 
> 1. biologists' ideas of biological diversity;
> 2. biologists' promotion of biological diversity to the public;
> 3. the public's actions and values vis-à-vis biological diversity;
> 4. and changes in diversity itself. 
> 
> Events along each timeline affect and constrain the others. 

This structure that Takacs proposes may be useful in doing a multilayered, 'social network analysis' *à la* [2020-Renn](2020-Renn.md), as [social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md). 

In this case, there seems to be a *partial* mapping of Renns' and Takac's categories, althought Takac's are more broad (they fall under different analytical categories of epistemic networks)
1. "biologists' ideas of biological diversity" is part of the **semantic dimension** of the epistemic network.
2. "biologists' promotion of biological diversity to the public" is part of the **social dimension** of the epistemic network.
3. "the public's actions and values vis-à-vis biological diversity" is part of the **social and semantic dimensions** of the epistemic network.
4. "changes in diversity itself" is part of the **semiotic dimension** of the epistemic network. 


Now, Takacs goes on to describe the work of several men (and a woman) in the history of the making of *biodiversity*.

#### Aldo Leopold (1887–1948)

![Aldo | 300](https://baynature.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Aldo-Leopold-photo_2.jpg)

> Aldo Leopold (1887-1948) was a forester, game manager, wild-life ecologist, hunter, philosopher, and writer.<sup>5</sup> Prominent environmental historians and philosophers have mined Leopold's writings, which offer a rich lode for (sometimes contradictory) exegesis.<sup>6</sup> (p. 11)

One of his most well-known works: *A Sand County Almanac*. 

> When we examine the public defense of biodiversity by today's conservation biologists, we find that Leopold was often there first. He writes of restoration ecology. He recognizes the connections between cultural and biological diversity. He sees that economic valuations of biological species are often cheap rationalizations, yet he nonetheless presents nature as a multifarious resource for humankind.<sup>10</sup>(p. 12)

I am curious about the similarities and tensions between"economic valuations" and "nature as a mutlifarious resource": [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md)

> He [Leopold] cites as a rationale for conservation "the tacit **evidence** of evolution, in which diversity and stability are so closely intertwined as to seem to names for one fact." Leopold observes that "science has given us many doubts, but it has given us at least one certainty: the trend of evolution is to elaborate and diversify the biota."
> 
> Herein lies the problem with **relying on scientific facts** for the tenets of an **environmental ethic**: science is sometimes wrong. The facts of ecology and evolution on which to base this ethic may turn out to be the wishes of the ethic makers. The ecological theory that correlates species diversity with ecological stability seems to have been widely violated. Leopold's "one certainty" of science has been recently made somewhat less certain, if we accept Stephen Jay Gould's contention that the "cone of diversity" is just another ecological myth, and that evolution produced its maximum diversity over 500 million years ago. (p. 15)
> [...]
> How can one ever extricate what the natural world really tells us from what we wish the natural world told us? Years after Leopold's death, the creators of the term *biodiversity* would come to recognize the skien of human desires wrapped around nature. They, like Leopold before them, would derive a set of values from ecological science, just as they have derived facts. Both facts and valuers are open to debate; both lie within the ecologists' ambit. (p. 15)

Here is one of the tensions of environmental ethics: [relying on scientific facts to develop an ethic is problematic](relying%20on%20scientific%20facts%20to%20develop%20an%20ethic%20is%20problematic.md).

> Leopold presents nature as a resource for people in part because to do otherwise would be hypocrisy. The land serves us by rpoviding the basis for agriculture, meat to fill bodily cravings, beauty to satisfy our aesthetic cravings, experinces to fill our need for adventure, and moral lessons to help us live ethical lives. Biological diversity provides a diversity of functions for humans; even in protecting it and mourning its loss, we learna lesson about what it means to be fully human.<sup>25</sup> (p. 16)

This contributes to the understanding of [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md), seeing how Leopold's understanding of 'use' and 'pragmatism' was inclusive and was not reduced to economic value. 

#### Charles S. Elton (1900–1992)

![Elton | 300](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZcjyTpXcAAq28d.jpg)

> In tracing the arcadian and imperial strands of ecology's history, Donald Worster casts British ecologists Charles S. Elton (1900–1992) as something of a villain: Elton led twentieth-century ecolgoy down the less desired "imperial" path, paving the way for a public conception of nature calculated in unappealing economic figures snd measured by energy meters.<sup>38</sup> Categories Worster presents as dichotomous may in fact be interpenetrating: Leopold took Elton's ecological systems and biotic pyramids and made them fundamentals in his land ethic. And when Elton began to tackle conservation, he had clearly been influenced by *A Sand County Almanac*. (p. 22)

This further helps understand [what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?](what%20are%20the%20nuances%20between%20an%20economic%20vision%20and%20useful%20vision%20of%20nature?.md), and seeing how, in fact, they are have been historically co-constructed. 

> Elton's final chapter [in *The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants*], "The Conservation of Variety", reveals his ecologist's slant on the world. He is not concerned with individual species, so much the fouc of conservation efforts then and later. Rather, he is interest in a forerunner of biodiversity, "ecological variety", which he treats as a concrete entity requiring our concern and protection. What counts is the dynamics of the ecological community, the innumerable complex interactions that keep systems stable. The ideal state of nature is diverse wilderness, epitomized by the tropic rain forest. 
> [...] 
> Balance, stability, richness, diversity, and complexity: these qualities good in human communities are said to be good in ecological communties, too. [...] It would be several decades after Elton before ecologists would suggest that it's a jungle out there: balance has been superseded by chaos. (p. 24)

Here we see how Elton contributes to the [mid-20th century movements of revaluing diversity, where 'biodiversity' became a normative concept and a "vital resource" for mankind](from%20the%20mid-20c%20'biodiversity'%20became%20a%20normative%20concept%20and%20a%20"vital%20resource"%20for%20mankind.md). 

> Elton's conservation ethic in *Invasions* aims at practical ends that are both ambitious and modest. He was a political scientist: he helped form the British Nature Conservancy and then used it to lobby for conservation goals. (p. 24)
> [...]
> *The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants* attempts to change established attitudes, to forge new ethics. As a pragmatist, Elton consigned wilderness to the patron saint of lost causes. He was willing, instead, to settle for the preservation or re-creation fo remnant scraps of ecological variety in the managed landscape. Ecology provides the scientific facts and the scientific fears that will prompt other to see the **desirability** of his prescriptions [...] He sought to put his decades of scientific research to work to change the way people viewed the landscape, so that they would change the landscape that they viewed. (p. 25)


Elton's views were also highly pragmatic, contributing to the evidence that. [there has been a movement towards pragmatism in the history of environmentalism](there%20has%20been%20a%20movement%20towards%20pragmatism%20in%20the%20history%20of%20environmentalism.md).


#### Rachel Carson (1907–64)

![Carson | 300](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freshvista.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2FRachelCarson.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

> Wildlife biologist and best-selling author Rachel Carson (1907–64) also used ecological science to change the way we see and feel. Her early works focused on the wonders of nature in general and the marine environments in particular. By her indelibre descriptions, she wished her readers to see what she saw and feelw what she felt. In *Silent Spring* (1962), she channeled Elton's ecological ideas towards a more potent and political end than he did.<sup>50</sup> *Silent Spring* documents the terrifying threat uncontrolled use of pesticides posed to nature's beauty and human health–a world threat that could be overcome only by a thoroughly ecological worldview. (p. 26)


> In *Silent Spring*, **scientist are the enemies** who have begotten the chemicals that beget death and destruction: "The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modern and terrible **weapons**, and that in turning them against the insects it has also tunred them against the earth."<sup>53</sup> But **scientists are also the sources of salvation**, creating alternatives to those chemicals and revealing hitherto obscure interrelationships within nature and human relationships with anture. For Carson, **ecologists repay the debt of science to society** by forging a worldview for us all to adopt so that we may, before it is too late, come to appreciate the services natural variety performs for us. (p. 26)

Carson and her book *Silent Spring* is one of the forerunners of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility) in the 20th century. In this section, we see the double-edge sword of science: both the creator of the destruction and the possibility for salvation. Pesticides, as a scientific invention by the chemical industries is opposed by the mission of ecologists, who in Takac's account of Carson's view, can "repay the debt of science to society." (p. 27). This double-edge sword contributes to the question of [what is the late-modern concept of 'reflexivity'?](what%20is%20the%20late-modern%20concept%20of%20'reflexivity'?.md).


#### David Ehrenfeld

![Ehrenfeld | 300](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwhitepineprograms.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2FJoan-and-David-300x300.png&f=1&nofb=1)

> During the 1960s and 1970s, the growing reification of diversity kept pace with perceived threats to the natural reality to which the term referred. [...] During the 1970s, David Ehrenfeld promoted the role of the biologist as "advocate for the natural world" in two books, *Conserving Life on Earth* (1972) and *The Arrogance of Humanism* (1978). Ehrenfeld (who has a medical degree and earned a doctorate studying sea turtles) sought simulatneously to bring the ecological perspective to a broad audience, to promote nonanthropocentric reasons for diversity conservation, and to get as many people as possible to experience nature for themselves, so that they would not need a host of convoluted rationalizations to become convinced of the values of biological diversity (p. 30)

#### Inventing Biodiversity (Myers, the Ehrlich's)
> In the 1970s and 1980s, ecologists developed detailed arguments for the economic and ecological value of biological diversity. Norman Myers's *The Sinking Ark: A New Look at the Problem of Disappearing Species* and Paul and Anne Ehrlich's *Extincition: The Causes and Consequences of the Dissappearance of Species* graphically depict the severity of the biological diversity crisis. (p. 34)

This framing of biodiversity and exctinction as opposing forces, as we see from this titles and Takacs description, falls in line with [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md)'s thesis that [in the 1970s, 'biodiversity' was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'exctinction'](in%20the%201970s,%20'biodiversity'%20was%20revalorised,%20and%20in%20part%20due%20to%20new%20views%20on%20'exctinction'.md).

> While they present many pragmatic arguments for biological diversity's importance, both book operate from their authro's deeply felt belief that humans have no right to eliminate other species. [...] The Ehrlichs, too, are driven by deeper motives: "This is fundamentally a religious argument," they write. "There is no scientific way to 'prove' that nonhuman organisms (or for that matter, human organisms) have a right to exist" (p. 35)

This is one key point: [[the value of 'biodiversity' is not given by science]], which ties well with the evidence that [biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation](biodiversity%20is%20not%20an%20analytic%20concept%20but%20a%20political%20motivation.md). 

#### A section on the history of the Washington conference on BioDiversity

> Perhaps the most potent recruiting tool to emerge from the conference was the term *biodiversity*. [Walter G.] Rosen first penned the neologism as conveninent shorthand. He recalls, "It was easy to do: all you do is take the 'logical' out of the 'biological.''" He means this ironically: "To take the logical out of something that's supposed to be science is a bit of a contradiction in terms, right? [...]". Wilson at first opposed the term as "too glitzy," but he now admits that Rosen "turned out to be completely right."
> […]
> I asked Dan Janzen, who was invited by Wilson to speak at the forum, why *biodiversity* has become such a potent buzzword in the conservation movement. "Several reasons," he replied: "One is deliberate. The Washing Conference? That was an explicit political event, explicitly designed to make Congresss aware of this complexity of species that we're losing. […] A lot of us went to that talk on a political mission. We were asked, will we come and do this thing? So we did." (p.37)

Further fuel to sustain the idea that [biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation](biodiversity%20is%20not%20an%20analytic%20concept%20but%20a%20political%20motivation.md).

> The National Forum on BioDiversity almost failed to come off. […] According to Rosen, the NAS was "very, very upset about" the possibility that the forum might "turn into an exercise in advocacy … From their point of view, the Academy owes its reputation for objectivity and what have you to the fact that they're *not* advocates."
> […]
> The forum did go on, from 21 to 24 September 1986, and all that the gurardians of objectivity at the Academy might have feared to come to pass. It was here, as Laura Tangley notes, that biologists who loved biological diversity came out of the closet. Develoopment experts, economists, and even ethicists and theologians joined the impressive array of biologists to dicuss the biodiversity crisis.
> […]
> They also came to *create* the biodiversity crisis, at least in the minds of the press, the politicos, and the public. The forum, Rosen said, was "an exercise in conseciousness raising,"

### Chapter 3. 'Why & whence the term *biodiversity*?'

> as a conservation strategy, particularly one biologists can control, it [the concept of 'wilderness preservation'] is redolent of class priviledge, culturally rooted, and ontologically precarious. A strategy based on biodiversity may eventually be judged similarly; but, as we shall see below, it has many strenghts and co-opts much of what makes the idea of wilderness so attractive. Desire for habitat and ecosystem protection may be a proxy for wilderness preservation, the desire for untrammeled vast reaches; these can bge smuggled in under the biodiversity concept. (p. 43)

*biodiversity* came to be a much more resilient (from attacks of 'class priviledge') and inclusive (without so many commitments to what 'nature' and 'wilderness' looks like) concept than one of its predecesors, *wilderness*. 

> *Global Biodiversity Strategy: Guidelines for Action to Save, Study, and Use Earth's Biotic Wealth Sustainably adn Equitably*, a document prepared in conjuction with the Rio Earth Summit, states that "cultural diversity is closely linked to biodiversity" (p. 44)

Explicit links between cultural and biological diversity.

> **Definitions of biodiversity**
> I began nearly all my interviews with conservation biologists by asking for a definition of *biodiversity* (p. 46-50)

[biodiversity, as conceptualized by scientists is already an ambiguous concept tied to different ontological commitments](biodiversity,%20as%20conceptualized%20by%20scientists%20is%20already%20an%20ambiguous%20concept%20tied%20to%20different%20ontological%20commitments.md) The answers are extremely varied:
- as synonym of life
- as a property of life
- as a value
- as a measure
- as a product
- as a thing in nature
- as an statistical feature of living systems

This shows us that the conceptual confusion around *biodiversity* is not just a matter of debates about how to measure it, but it's in fact an <u>ontological confusion</u>.

> ![](meanings%20of%20biodiversity,%20fig%203.1%20(p.%2051)%20in%20Takacs's%201996.jpg)
 >
>Figure 3.1 suggests the confusion surrounding just what ecosystems represent to different biologists, and the confusion about what such broad definition of *biodiversity* might mean. (p. 51)


> The semantic evolution from *endangered species* to *biodiversity* parallels an evolution in how biologists view the world, with concomitant evolution in what they want preserved. And biodiversity's breadth resolves (at least temporarily) a number of tricky problems that arise from narrow focus on endangered species.(p. 52) 

Takacs claims that the framing of environmental issues on endangered species is a "narrow focus", and that the framing of biodiversity has a bigger "breadth [that] resolves (at least temporarily) a number of tricky problems." This, at least, [nuances](in%20the%201970s,%20'biodiversity'%20was%20revalorised,%20and%20in%20part%20due%20to%20new%20views%20on%20'exctinction'.md#A%20nuance%20coming%20from%20Takacs) the position we found in [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md) and [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md) that our concept of 'biodiversity' is highly linked to a reframed, biologised concept of 'extinction'. 

Takacs reports on the contemporary debates about the evidence supporting the idea that the rate of extinction has gone up. He also argues that by shifting to explain the environmental problem in the 'biodiversity' frame, "the switch to a strategy based on biodiversity can make species counts superfluous; instead, conservation comes to focus on pattern, process, and multiple hierarchical levels." (p. 53)

> if the government is mandated to save endangered species, and no one is quite sure what a species is, or if a given organism is or is not a member of a distinct species, then how are we to proceed? (p. 53)

Contributing to the [A nuance coming from Takacs](in%20the%201970s,%20'biodiversity'%20was%20revalorised,%20and%20in%20part%20due%20to%20new%20views%20on%20'exctinction'.md#A%20nuance%20coming%20from%20Takacs): the biodiversity approach does not rely on blurry definiton of what counts as 'species'.

> Targetting species as the exclusive level of conservation becomes dubious practice when species turn out not to be species, and when that is not necessarily what we want to save anyway. We attempt to avoid such problems by moving to the broad aegis of biodiversity, while still retaining some of the features that have made species an appealing focus for conservation (p. 54)

This is the best evidence of how biodiversity has a "bigger breath" than species-by-species conservation. 

> Paul and Anne Ehrlich metaphorically describe this ad the **"rivetpopping" problem**. Imagine yourself on an airplane about to take off. You see someone crawling along the wing, slowly removing one rivet after another. The plan can certainly fly without some of the rivets, but eventually the wing will fall off. (p. 55) [...] We avoid the slippery slopes that spell peril for conservationists' arguments when we focus–that is, the totality whose implicit values underlies all arguments for individual species. (p. 56) [...] Here, again, we encounter the **problem of incrementalism**, or rivetpopping, or the slippery slope: at some point, the biologists agree, ecosystem function will be impaired and the system will degenerate. *This* is what's important, and this is addressed more effectively by focus on biodiversity rather than focus on individual speicies that may or may not be important to sustaining overall biotic processes. (p. 57)

Biodiversity has a bigger breadth compared to the species-by-species approach because it allows to argue for conservation *given* uncertainty. There are a lot of uncertainties:
- uncertain future value of a species
- uncertain consequence of their extinction
- uncertain interactions 
- uncertain behavior of species and climate given "global warming"


> You can feel Woodruff's ambibalence about making decisions he knows must be made, while knowing that the criteria for making those decisions are not available, and that even if they were available, they would not be clear-cut. Switching rhetoric to biodiversity can help us avoid having to make these decisions, at least on a species-by-species basis. (p. 61)

Changing from a species-by-species rhetoric to a biodiversity rhetoric allows to avoid the triage problem, Takacs asserts. But I am not so certain either:
- (1) that the biodiversity rhetoric is actionable: at the end of the day, biologists will have to count something, and species are the most pragmatic thing to count. The biodiversity rhetoric is not new anymore, but biologists are still using species as proxys for that biodiversity.
- (2) that even it is actionable, we can avoid triage problem, since the way it is actionable is by counting species.

> Frankel and Soulé urge a switch away from "preservation," the maintenance of static entities, towards "conservation," which allows for continued evolutionary change. (p. 67)

[the difference between "preservation" vs "conservation" is that "preservation" looks to mantain static entities, while "conservation" aims at mantaining the conditions for evolutionary change to take place](the%20difference%20between%20%22preservation%22%20vs%20%22conservation%22%20is%20that%20%22preservation%22%20looks%20to%20mantain%20static%20entities,%20while%20%22conservation%22%20aims%20at%20mantaining%20the%20conditions%20for%20evolutionary%20change%20to%20take%20place.md).

> "It is not *form* (species) as a mere morphology, but the *formative* (speciating) process that humans ought to preserve, alhtough the process cannot be preserved without its products," Rolston writes. (p. 67)

It seems that the difference between "preservation" and "conservation" maps also the difference between, respectively, species-by-species approach and biodiversity approach to wildlife management: the former attends to keeping the "form" (preserving the species), while the latter cares about the evolutionary dynamics (the "formation" of species). 


> Biologists place eminent value on the evolutionary process. By conserving biodiversity, we conserve variation at all the levels–genetic, population, species, community, ecosystem–that allow the evolutionary process to continue, that provide the capacity for nature to change, to revound, to evolve. Protecting endangered species may connote a commitment to keeping things the way they are; biodiversity conservation is a broad mandate for change. (p. 68)
> 
> Jerry Franklin: "[We should be]" beginning to swing more towards putting energy into ecosystems than enlarging the continuing lists of endangered species." […] Vickie Funk: "I think it's really not switching to biodiversity so much as it's switching to the concept, and then *biodiversity* is a handy word for it." (p. 70)

> Yet if we focus on species is politically expensive and practically infeasible, and if it is ecosystem or habitat that is more important, why not focus efforts on ecosystem or habitat conservation? Why has *biodiversity* become the key buzzword in conservation circles in the 1990s? (p. 72)

It seems as though in the 1990s there was conceptual agreeement between biologists that a focus on ecosystems, habitats, and biodiversity was much better, and a lot of hope was put into abandoning lists of endangered species. A question could be posed (that my project *doesn't* address): was this all a hype, or have we trully moved into the 'biodiversity' paradigm in actual scientific practice?

> Dan Janzen spells this [the idea that with biodiversity you can use the different components of ecosystems and use the ones that suit you better, like focusing on endangered charismatic species] out clearly: "[...] Well, biodiversity is a list of species in some people's minds. It's very easy to talk about it and say, 'Well, what's biodiversity?' And you list the ten species. And you say, 'Why should you care about it?' Because you should care about these ten species. So it's pragmatically comfortable and easy. And what that translates to is reporters can pick it up easily. TV can pick it up easily. And they can–you can take photographs of objects in biodiversity–i.e., species or individuals–very easily. Put them on the television set, put them on the wall and all that kind of stuff. Habitats is very hard to photograph. To most people it looks like a green blob" (p. 74)

> The neologism *biodiversity* crystallizes a new approach, a new perspective for conservation, one that requires biologists to appeal to the media in the first place. (p. 74)

Here a visual summary of this chapter, putting in a continuum the different approaches / tools of conservation:

> The term *nature* not only carries a multiplicity of confusing, often self-serving, meanings; it also arries the tain of association with bleeding-heart liberal tree huggers. To be considered a "nature lover" is not a compliment in many quarters. So rather than running to nature, biologists flee from it. Instead, they describe and defend biodiversity. It maintains an aura of scientific respectability while still meaning so many different things to so many different people, without having yet acquired the notorious etymological reputation of the word *nature*. (p. 76) [...] By scientizing the concept nature, biologists aim to convince you that the biodiversity crisis is grave and that they have special expertise in understanding and addressing it. (p. 79-80)

> *Biodiversity* has entered the dictionary, people respond to it, it works, because each of us can find it in what we cherish: the biologist can find her study subject or conservation goal, the policy maker can isolate the fragment of the biological world that demands legistlative focus, and the rest of us can conjure up any icon from nature that we wish to see endure. What is it you most prize in the natural world? Yes, biodiversity is that too. In biodiversity each of us finds a mirror for our most treasured natural images, our most fervent environmental concerns. (p. 81)

These are clear examples of how biodiversity is a heavily plastic concept with myriad of meanings depending on the context, perfect for a conceptual history approach.
