**Take-home message**: A short blogplost against counting invasive species within biodiversity counts. Simberloff gives three specific reasons: 1) the CBD and Aichi Targets already explicitly recognise the danger of invasive species, 2) the total number of species is not what matters in an ecosystem, and 3) there are too many complex and unpredictable interactions within an ecosystem and it is hard to predict the risks of benefits of an invasive species being introduced. See details below.

## Reading notes

> There have been calls for biodiversity and ecosystem assessments to count non-native species as well as their native counterparts as positively contributing to biological diversity. Daniel Simberloff, Gore Hunger Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Tennessee and member of the Invasive Species Specialist Group of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission, explains why this approach is misguided and would hinder our ability to achieve international conservation and development goals.

Abstract. 

> Non-native species **homogenise** ecosystems and, in some instances, cause populations of native species to plummet to the point of local **extinction**. The true impact of non-native species on ecosystems may take time, even decades, to become obvious, by which point it is often too late to reverse negative impacts from these intruders. This presents a problem for the entire ecosystem, including the humans who rely on ecosystem services for their well-being.

Here we see that [the problem with invasive species is that they homogenise ecosystems and in the worst case cause the exctinction of other species](the%20problem%20with%20invasive%20species%20is%20that%20they%20homogenise%20ecosystems%20and%20in%20the%20worst%20case%20cause%20the%20exctinction%20of%20other%20species.md). 

> Despite the potential long-term impacts of non-native species, there have been controversial calls in both popular science writing (Fred Pearce, _The New Wild_) and in the [scientific literature](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005568) for non-native species to be counted equally with native species in biodiversity assessments, for example in those used to track progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). […] 


The AIchi Biodiversity Targets as one of the guiding framework to assess progress (or lack of thereof).

> It is misguided and potentially disastrous to consider native and non-native species as equal from the standpoint of both ecosystem services and conservation goals, including the Aichi Targets of the CBD and UN Sustainable Development Goals. […] The reasons are elaborated in a [recent article](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006686) by 26 invasion scientists from around the world, but I would like to comment on three particular issues relevant to both ecosystem services and the IUCN mission.

A link to an article ('Biodiversity assessments: Origin matters') arguing against counting invasive species within the biodiversity count. He goes on two argue a similar point, using three arguments:
1. the CBD and Aichi Targets explicitly recognise **the danger of invasive species**. Also, including them as part of the biodiversity count is not the intended use and meaning of those metrics.
2. Given extrinsic and intrinscic defences of biodiversity, the **total number** of species is not what helps produce good for human consumption nor what we should be valuing. Rather, it is individual, singular species which gives products for human consumption (extrinsic argument) and have a unique value that needs to be preserved (intrinsic argument).
3. There are **complex interactions between species**, so from a scientific standpoint is hard to assess ecological value and predict the useful products that ecosystems can generate. Allowing for invasive species to be counted in leads to misleading information in already complex systems.  

> Firstly, the Convention on Biological Diversity – the multilateral treaty initiated in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro to conserve biodiversity and ensure its sustainable use and the equitable sharing of its benefits – suggests that humanity should value biodiversity for its “actual or potential use or value for humanity”. Article 8h specifically recognises the threat non-native species pose to this use or value. The associated Aichi Targets, adopted in Nagoya in 2010, indicate progress toward achieving the CBD goals through Target 9 – preventing and controlling alien species, and Target 12 – preventing extinction of native species by alien species

> Simply including non-native species in the tally of total biodiversity produces a misleading appearance of progress toward CBD goals.

> Secondly, if one accepts the premise that a primary purpose of biodiversity is for human use, the complex nature of biodiversity and the interactions within ecosystems are poorly understood. For the best-studied service – production of gross biomass, such as food or fibre – particular species or types of species (such as rice or wheat), rather than the total number of species, are crucial to producing the service. In addition, losing a phylogenetically distinct species because of non-native invasive species is an irrevocable loss of history that we ought to mourn in its own right, not just for the services it could have provided to humans had we saved it.

> Finally, ecosystem services are not discrete – the species providing one service, like production of food, often influence the provision of other services, such as adequate supplies of clean water. It is difficult to prove that an increase in the total number of species, as opposed to sets of particular species, leads to an increase in the number of services provided. One would have to understand the contribution of all these species – native and non-native – to all ecosystem services to determine the importance of species number and species interactions for ecosystem services provision. This sort of ecological research is in its infancy and scientists cannot yet answer such questions. We cannot yet specify all the services that ecosystems provide, much less the role the interactions between species play in providing them.

> The IUCN mission recognises the value of all biodiversity, and the IUCN Species Survival Commission strives to create “a just world that values and conserves nature through positive action to reduce the loss of diversity of life on earth.” T**he flood of non-native species that is homogenising ecosystems is erasing the very differences that we value and rely upon to sustain life on earth**. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that simply by increasing the numbers of species locally or regionally, we are meeting international and highly important conservation targets.
