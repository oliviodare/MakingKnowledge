# one of the main issues of conservation biology is dealing with funding, which is dealt with by setting 'conservation priorities'

The main problem is always a lack of funding, and the main question is: how to conserve the most amount species with a limited, fixed cost? Given this financial framework, the concept of 'biodiversity hotspots' arises. The identification of a hotspot as such is the product of a co-construction between a reality ("As many as 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth", [Myers et al 2000](Myers%20et%20al%202000.md)) and a pre-linguistic given (financial limits). Conservation hotspots are those spaces where financial investment can return more benefits (i.e., saving more species).

Many of the conservation efforts come from private foundations ([there are several private foundations that invest in conservation projects](there%20are%20several%20private%20foundations%20that%20invest%20in%20conservation%20projects.md))
