# philosophy of species takes scientific literature to be the main object of study

philosophy of species takes scientific literature to be the main object of study, not taking in count either the scientific practice itself not the political, social, and cultural context in which conservation projects are take place. A focus on published literature is a very schewed vision on such an interventionist science. It is thus not surprising that the main philosophical position that is typically defended by philosophers, as in [Justus 2010](Justus%202010.md) is a pluralistic position.
