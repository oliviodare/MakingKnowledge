While the title of this note is true, we must take into account the shifting changes in meaning. It seems as though [diversity is at the core of conservation biology but its meanings have changed](diversity%20is%20at%20the%20core%20of%20conservation%20biology%20but%20its%20meanings%20have%20changed.md), and that there has been a shift from seeing 'biodiversity' as an unjustifiable preference towards seeing it as a scientific concept.
