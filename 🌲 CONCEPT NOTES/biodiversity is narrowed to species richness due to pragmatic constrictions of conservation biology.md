# biodiversity is narrowed to species richness due to pragmatic constrictions of conservation biology

The contexts in which species richness is defended as a good measure of biodiversity are those that take into account the constrictions of conservation biology, such as the financial constrictions in [Myers et al 2000](Myers%20et%20al%202000.md).

The constrictions are financial (limited resources), epistemic (species richness is a good-enough surrogate, according to [Sarkar 2002](Sarkar%202002.md)), and of the practices (it's "readily recognizable").

Those constrictions make it so [one of the main issues of conservation biology is dealing with funding, which is dealt with by setting 'conservation priorities'](one%20of%20the%20main%20issues%20of%20conservation%20biology%20is%20dealing%20with%20funding,%20which%20is%20dealt%20with%20by%20setting%20'conservation%20priorities'.md)
