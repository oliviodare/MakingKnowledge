# conservation biologists are aware and critical of industrialisation

They professional efforts in conserving biodiveristy and managing limited funds (althought not negligible) are often put in stark contrast with the bigger investments in industrialisation (what is often called "perverse subsidies", in [Myers et al 2000](Myers%20et%20al%202000.md)). Myers et al argued in 2000 that the conservatin of the biggest x hotspots on earth would cost $500 million a year, but while this is much more than what had been spent (around $400 million spent on hotspots during 1990-2000), they still argued that 'perverse subsidies' have an investment of about $1.5 trillion a year.
