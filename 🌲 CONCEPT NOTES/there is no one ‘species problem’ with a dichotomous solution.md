 # there is no one ‘species problem’ with a dichotomous solution
 
 
 The debates in philosophy of biology, and specially, in regard to the  speciesproblem are varied. In fact, there is no one ‘species problem’ with a dichotomous solution, and shouldn't be lumped together. 
 
 There are at least two problems of species:
 - Ontological: *is Nature ordered in species?* Here we are dealing with the ealism of species as a concept out there.
 - Epistemic: *can we come up with a single definition of what counts as species?* Here we are dealing with realism about a single definition of species. 

Regarding the former, this seems to be a more complex issue. The latter, most people agree that we have to be pluralist.
