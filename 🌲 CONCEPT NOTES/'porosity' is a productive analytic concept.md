# 'porosity' is a productive analytic concept


Based on [Pritchard and Zimring 2020](Pritchard%20and%20Zimring%202020.md), the notion of 'porosity' is related to the the perhaps more well-known idea of unclear boundaries between two categories. In their case, they aim at drawing a conceptual framework for an environtech history which relates the relationship between human and non-human systems and the categories associated with them ("environmental", "natural", "technological"). They argue that the boundaries between technology and nature are not only unclear, but ***porous***, drawing an attention not just to how classification is problematic, but towards the causal action between one and the ohter. Thus, the job of the environtech historian is not simply to point to the nuances of the discourse, but to describe how, when, and which parts of nature and technology exactly interact.
