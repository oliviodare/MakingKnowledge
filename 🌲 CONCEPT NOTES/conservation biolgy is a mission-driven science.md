# conservation biolgy is a mission-driven science


From the outset, as we can see in the landmark paper 'What is Conservation Biology', Soulé argued that conservation biology is a "mission- or crisis-oriented discipline". At its core, was the preservation of biological diversty and protecting it from the "human activites or other agents." Thus, the relation of humans with their environment was explicitly put at the center of conservation biology, the main problem was framed as a loss of biodiveristy, and the solution as a preservation of it through a multidisciplinary (yet predominantly biological) understanding of the dynamics of the environment. 

One of the definitions of mission- or crisis-driven sciences is, according to Soulé, that they have to deal with uncertainty as many of the phenomena under study require urgency. This aspect of urgency may be one of the characteristics that addresses the question of [how does the temporal dimension mediate understandings of biodiversity?](how%20does%20the%20temporal%20dimension%20mediate%20understandings%20of%20biodiversity?.md)

Understanding that conservation biology was from the outset a mission-driven enterprise helps understand why [biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation](biodiversity%20is%20not%20an%20analytic%20concept%20but%20a%20political%20motivation.md).

The idealistic political motivation of conservation biologists, despite knowing that it was an unrealistic ambitious aim, was to shift the state of nature towards a preindustrial balance. A more modest aim, however, was to "modify significantly the rate" of the destruction of diversity. Technology and industrialisation were seen as the enemy that cannot be avoided, the discipline of biology as the value-neutral enterprise that would generate theories and evidence, and conservation biology as the translator of those idealistic scenarios into practical managerial realities.
