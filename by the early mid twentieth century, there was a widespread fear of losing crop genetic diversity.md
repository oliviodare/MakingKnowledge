By the early mid twentieth century, there was a widespread fear among 'agriculturalists' of losing crop genetic diversity as the reliance on commercial hybrid varieties was steadily becoming the norm in the global North. 

The concrete fear was that losing diversity meant that some traits that were specific of certain crop varieties would be lost and could be useful in the future. This was a "Darwinian" fear: what if the environment changes, and it threatens the survival of a homogenous species? I don't know exactly how this would relate to Sepkoski's point that [the pre-1970s view on extinction was Darwinian](the%20pre-1970s%20view%20on%20extinction%20was%20Darwinian.md).

Fear about losing genetic crop diversity is a concrete example of [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility) and fits with the story that [the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility](the%20second%20half%20of%20the%20twentieth%20century%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20collective%20environmental%20reflexivity%20and%20sensibility.md). 

The scientific reflexivity, in this specific context is:  
1. diversity needed to construct 'the good' hybrid crop to be used in industrial agriculture 
2. the implementation of 'the good' crop threatens that diversity.
