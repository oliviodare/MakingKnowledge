## Sections, subsections, and themes
### I. Capitalised: Bought space, free catalogues
*This section provides a good introduction to adverts, some of which I'd like to maintain.*

- Short history of adverts in Nature
- Prices increase in the 1970s
- Administration by TG Scott, then within Macmillan
- Newly on the market
- Functional aspects of advertisements
- Catalogues and their intimate relation in research


### II. Bold: Marketing strategies
*I may need to rearrange and define a more appropiate structure between section II (marketting strategies) and III (epistemic virtues), especially in the relation of 'novelty' with 'standarisation'. The connection between marketing strategies and epistemic virtues may in itself be a good point!*

- Simple design
- Humour, controversy, and ambiguity
- Novelty
- Credibility, trust in manufacturer: selling the best and newest equipment, always in touch with the research community.
	- Technical and specialised language


### III. Underlined: Commercial epistemic virtues
*An important issue here would be whether the elements which I identified and discussed are really 'epistemic virtues'*

- visual supremacy and visual realism
- unrealistic presentations of laboratory objects, posing as concentrated men
- NOVELTY AND STANDARISATION: the relation between innovation, addition, and shared standards
	- internationalism yet personal service
- eased operation of machinery, automatization, speed, no need for exhaustive training to use it, which is related to:
	- data realism
	- trust in manufacturers and their insertion as integral pieces of the community
	- despite ease of manipulation; understanding of the adverts and the advantage of the materials was very technical and specialised


### IV. Superscripted: Introducing social responsibility
*This would be the theme I am most unsure of *

- busy, cost conscious, forward thinking
	- placing laboratory's economy, technical aspects and social demands together as a way to insert themselves as researcher's goals and placement in society.
	- LABEX international



## Highlights and notes

> “With this chapter, I address the question: What can be learn from scientific advertisements? At the outset, I set myself both sceptical and hopeful about the power of these visual objects for telling a story about science. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 41)

I need to be more assertive on the publication.
> “The combination of the graphic and linguistic characteristics used in advertisements, purposely designed for engaging in action, highlights elements of the historical moment that other sources may lack. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 41) 

Could rephrase as: "The combination of the graphic and linguistic characteristics used in advertisements, [**as well as the political context in which they were pinted,**] purposely designed for engaging in action, highlights elements of the historical moment that other [**written/formal**] sources may lack.""


> “However, I am convinced that the scientific advertisements won’t talk by themselves. They will most certainly be missing some of the analytical precision that a historical study requires. For that, I will explore in the upcoming chapters the mirror image of this chapter: which elements outside the advertisements need to be included in order to understand them? Some advertisements leave one puzzled, what do they mean? For example, why did the manufacturer Collaborative Research make a political joke about Cold War politics to sell insolubilized oligonucleotides? To reconstruct the meaning of some advertisements, they need to be contextualised within the place and moment where they were printed. The most proximal context is the magazine Nature itself, and specially, the political pieces: the lead editorials, News and Views sections, and the correspondence letters placed alongside the advertisements. I will start to develop this analysis here as a cue for the rest of the thesis. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 41) 

Although I won't delve deep into the political context, this is an issue which I will have to address.


> “My analysis in this chapter is synchronic. Advertisements in Nature came and went, but many stayed throughout various years. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 41) 

Need to look into whether I could expand to a diachronic analysis.
> “As my overall story in of this thesis is a narrative that uses both advertisements and political pieces, which both have their different tempos, I attend only superficially to chronological happenings. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 41)


> “The basis of my analysis here is extracting the elements that are present in the advertisements, attending especially to those elements that repeat themselves frequently in advertisements of different objects and from different companies. Paying attention to recurring elements allows me to sketch patterns of the epistemic and social virtues of molecular biology during the 1970s, through the eyes of for-profit manufacturers of laboratory objects. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 41) 

This methodological choice (looking for rhythms, *à la Sontag*) may need to be explained in more detail.


> “In this way, I will first sketch what sort of target the scientists are in the eyes of the biotechnology industry. Then, I will make a larger (and perhaps, more controversial) claim, arguing that ads are particularly important because they reflect more than attitudes towards scientists, but that they partially mirror the epistemic virtues that the scientific establishments foster. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 42) 

Main argument of this chapter.


> “As literal illustrations of the ideal science, ads convey to the historian the self-identity that the scientific community projects about itself towards those who are willing to listen. Those who are willing to listen were the readers of the magazine, in my case the molecular scientists themselves with an interest on radioactive ligands and automatic cell counters. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 42) 

How does this relate to the representationalist vs contextualist vision of visual images? (chapter 4)


> “this aspect of who were the advertisements for is only of minor importance in this chapter. The chain of events from marketing, observation, and acquisition is only of tangential interest. This functionalist approach would be daunting, as knowing the commercial effects of the advertisements or the reception by individual scientists may be a nearly impossible task. I am more interested in knowing what the ads were saying and how they could be read, paying more attention to the context of their printing (the magazine) than the response of the scientific community. In short, I don’t attend to the question ‘did advertisements accomplish more sales?’, I attend only partially to the question ‘how do advertisements work?’, and focus most of my investigation to exploring the question ‘what is a scientific advertising?’. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 42) 

I will still retain this approach.
> “manufacturers had to establish their credibility in the field” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 57) 

This could be one of the main claims of my paper
> “In order to gain a scientist’s trust, manufactures had to do better than making engaging jokes, selling ‘the new’, and promising ‘the best’. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 57) 

Following in up.
> “As exemplified until now, the scientific advertisement could be seen as a piece of advice, an advertised deal, the most rational in the category of marketing objects. They contained information that only a few selected could read and understand. As well, many advertisements had the added function of a fillable and mailable form. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 58) 

This is very important


> “This is a first sketch, in which I will attend to the epistemic virtues that the content of the ads referred to. As I mentioned in the introduction, historical virtue epistemology is a productive way of thinking about scientific research as practices whose behaviours and ways of thinking are ethically codified, and which prescribe certain way of being – certain scientific self. In the upcoming section I attend to the epistemic virtues that the manufacturers of objects highlighted of their products. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 58) 

If I reframe my question as one of: 'how did commercial companies insert themselves into being an intrinsic player of the academic community', the epistemic virtues could be seen as those which the community sought, and so the commercial companies adopted it. This is a very unidirectional analysis, though. We could also wonder what was the place of commercial companies in *shaping* those virtues as well.


> “These phrases showcase the way competition in the biotech industry was illustrated and resolved: innovation, addition, shared standards. Innovations were sold as raising the standard, a standard that had to be shared among competitors to stay afloat. ” (Bautista Perpinyà, 2020, p. 62) 

This is a key insight that I'd like to bring forward.
