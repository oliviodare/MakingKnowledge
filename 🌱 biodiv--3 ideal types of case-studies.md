# There are two (or three) potential 'ideal types' of case studies

Understanding ['ideal type' as an analytical unit for comparative historical analysis](the%20'ideal%20type'%20is%20an%20analytical%20unit%20for%20comparative%20historical%20analysis.md), I envision three ideal types of case studies. Following the notion that ideal types are analytical tools and do not necesarily conform perefectly to the boundaries found in historical cases, we could say that these idealised cases may overlap in terms of institutions, people, kinds of knowledge utilised, etc. However, a comparison between them (specially between 1 and 2) would be productive:

1. **Policy-oriented science advocacy**: a knowledge trickle-down approach, from consensus building at the level of the academic community, to the writing of reports addressed to a variety of stakeholders. 
	- Historical research methods: mostly insititutional archives of policy organisations.

2. **Locally-involved community** of a variety of stakeholders (scientists, NGOs, communities, politicians) that are involved in addressing the biodiversity crisis in a local and concrete level, perhaps with different approaches and methods, and even some or none of them framing their work as 'addressing the biodiversity crisis'.  
	- Historical research methods: oral history, personal archives, institutional archives. 

3. **'Biodiveristy' beyond conservation science**. These could be cases, like the one explored in [2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md), where 'biodiversity' plays a role, but not (necessarily) in the context of preserving it. Thus, these are not in the context of conservation biology and environmental science, but in other ones, such as industrial agriculture.
