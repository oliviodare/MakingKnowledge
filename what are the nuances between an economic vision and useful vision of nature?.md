# what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?
#conceptnote

It seems as though there seems to be a dualist approach when studying the different approaches to nature and arguments for defending ([environmental philosophers argue that there is no single environmental argument that works to defend biodiversity conservation](environmental%20philosophers%20argue%20that%20there%20is%20no%20single%20environmental%20argument%20that%20works%20to%20defend%20biodiversity%20conservation.md)), roughly falling under either 'intrinsic' and 'pragmatic' or 'extrinsic' arguments. However, I feels as though a more nuance analysis is necessary. 

[1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) writes of Leopold that he critiqued the "economic valuations"of nature, while still defening it "as a mutlifarious resource for humankind" (p. 12). I am curious about this tension, and I think that a 'pragmatic' argumentation in defense of biodiversity need not be reduced to an economic argument.
