# what are the nuances between an economic vision and useful vision of nature?
#conceptnote

It seems as though there seems to be a dualist approach when studying the different approaches to nature and arguments for defending ([environmental philosophers argue that there is no single environmental argument that works to defend biodiversity conservation](environmental%20philosophers%20argue%20that%20there%20is%20no%20single%20environmental%20argument%20that%20works%20to%20defend%20biodiversity%20conservation.md)), roughly falling under either 'intrinsic' and 'pragmatic' or 'extrinsic' arguments. However, I feels as though a more nuance analysis is necessary. 

[1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) writes of Leopold that he critiqued the "economic valuations"of nature, while still defening it "as a mutlifarious resource for humankind" (p. 12). I am curious about this tension, and I think that a 'pragmatic' argumentation in defense of biodiversity need not be reduced to an economic argument. Leopold successfully navigated that tension because he had a broad and inclusive concept of 'pragmatism': 
> Leopold presents nature as a resource for people in part because to do otherwise would be hypocrisy. The land serves us by rpoviding the basis for agriculture, meat to fill bodily cravings, beauty to satisfy our aesthetic cravings, experinces to fill our need for adventure, and moral lessons to help us live ethical lives. Biological diversity provides a diversity of functions for humans; even in protecting it and mourning its loss, we learna lesson about what it means to be fully human.<sup>25</sup>

And more explictly: 
> "It is inconceivable to me that an ethical relation to land can exists without love, respect, and admiration for alnd, and a high regard for its value. By value, I of course mean something far broader than mere economic value; I mean value in the philosophical sense," Leopold writes.<sup>33</sup> (p. 19)

Takacs further shows how two seemingly opposting attitudes towards nature (a scientific, quantitative-driven approach to an economic valuation vs. a intrinsic valuation of nature) have been historically co-constructed and how "Leopold took Elton's ecological systems and biotic pyramids and made them fundamentals in his land ethic. And when Elton began to tackle conservation, he had clearly been influenced by *A Sand County Almanac*."
