**Take-home message**: There has been an strong growth in the amount of OA papers. Published-OA (new papers) are driven by Gold and Hybrid modes of OA, and Made-OA (older papers) are driven mostly by Bronze OA, an unofficial, 'shadow OA' mode (i.e., publishers give it for free without an explicit OA license)
[[The proportion of OA papers has been progressively increasing since the 2000s]]

## Abstract

> Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free- to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.

## Highlights and notes


> "Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made freeto-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license.” (Piwowar et al., p. 1)



> - Gold: Published in an open-access journal that is indexed by the DOAJ.
> - Green: Toll-access on the publisher page, but there is a free copy in an OA repository. 
> - Hybrid: Free under an open license in a toll-access journal. 
> - Bronze: Free to read on the publisher page, but without an clearly identifiable license. 
> - Closed: All other articles, including those shared only on an ASN or in Sci-Hub.” (Piwowar et al., p. 5)


> "Figure 2 presents the number (Fig. 2A) and proportion (Fig. 2B) of papers by access category and publication date. Articles published in the last 20 years are increasingly OA, and this trend shows no sign of slowing. More recent articles are more likely to be OA, with the most recent year examined also containing the most OA: 44.7% of 2015 articles are OA” (Piwowar et al., p. 11)  

This is the main aspect important for my point: there seems to be an increase in percentage of OA publications: 44% of papers published in 2015 are OA.


> "Number of articles (A) and proportion of articles (B) with OA copies, estimated based on a random sample of 100,000 articles with Crossref DOIs. Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4375/fig-2” (Piwowar et al., p. 12) 

 This is the important figure.


> "(95% CI [43.3–46.2%]), including 17.6% Bronze (95% CI [16.2–19.1]), 9.4% Hybrid (95% CI [8.0–10.9]), 11.3% Gold (95% CI [9.9–12.8]), and 6.3% Green (95% CI [4.9–7.8]). Well over one million OA papers were published in 2015.” (Piwowar et al., p. 12)


> "This growth trend has largely been driven by dramatic growth in Gold and Hybrid OA since the year 2000. However, more than 20% of papers published before the digital age are also freely available. The majority of these older OA papers are Bronze, and based on their age they are probably more precisely Delayed OA, although additional investigation will be required to confirm this. Bronze OA remains remarkably constant as a proportion of the literature for all publication years examined.” (Piwowar et al., p. 12)  

The main explanation is the growth of gold OA journals (no apc, no subscription costs) and hybrid OA journals (no subscription costs, yes apc) for the newer publications, and the bronze OA for the older pre-2000 publications. 


> "We found that 28% of all journal articles are freely available online (Crossref-DOI sample). Encouragingly for proponents of OA, this proportion has been growing steadily over the last 20 years, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. Articles from 2015, the most recent year examined, had the highest proportion OA (45%), as well as the largest absolute number of OA articles published in a single year.” (Piwowar et al., p. 16)


> "Interestingly, we found that the majority of OA articles are Bronze–hosted on publisher websites, either without a license at all or without an open license. This is surprisingly high given that Bronze is relatively little-discussed in the OA literature, and suggests that this OA category deserves further attention from the OA community. In particular, Bronze OA may be significant in a policy context, since, unlike other publisher-hosted OA, Bronze articles do not extend any reuse rights beyond reading, making them Gratis OA. Much more research is needed into the characteristics of Bronze OA. How many Bronze articles are licensed openly, but do not make their license available? Is Bronze disproportionately non-peer-reviewed content? How much of Bronze OA is also Delayed OA? How much Bronze is Promotional, and how transient is the free-to-read status of this content? How many Bronze articles are published in ‘‘hidden gold’’ journals that are not listed in the DOAJ? Why are these journals not defining an explicit license for their content, and are there effective ways to encourage this? These and other questions are outside the scope of this study but may provide fruitful insights for future OA research and policy.” (Piwowar et al., p. 16)  

Bronze articles are part of the 'shadow oa', where there is no clear information on their licensing (and importantly, sustainability).
