# from the mid-20c 'biodiversity' became a normative concept and a "vital resource" for mankind
#conceptnote

The revalorisation of the concept of 'biodiversity' was tight together with new views on exctinction. Together with the paleontological evidence, there were several reasons by which, from the mid-20c 'biodiversity' became a normative concept ([diversity isn't a descriptive term, but a "supreme late-modern value"](diversity%20isn't%20a%20descriptive%20term,%20but%20a%20"supreme%20late-modern%20value".md)) and a "vital resource" for mankind:
  - ecologists emphasized more the f**ragile interconnectedness** of ecosystems, and the importance of all taxa in having an reaching an stable habitat.  
  - move towards **utilitarian** arguments in conservation and environmentalism.  
  - the **degradation** of the natural environment **sped up**, linked to a demographic expansion of Western societies. The consequences of antrhopogenic effects on the environment became clearer.  
  - the arguments supporting environmental care focused more on **unforeseen consequences** (there may be a link towards risk and #latermodernity here)  
   - despite the unforeseen consequences, biologists started to develop tools and aquire data to be able to **predict these consequences**.
