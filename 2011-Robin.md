## Reading notes

> "Biodiversity is a fundamental concept in global environmental management today. It is usually regarded as an ecological idea, but it is also a political idea and a tool for managing non-human nature" ([Robin 2011:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=2))

Main takeaway ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=2)).




> "This paper uses the methods of cultural history to analyse the emergence of biodiversity as a driver and shaper of policies and international conservation conventions, particularly where the conventions are responding to alarm or crisis." ([Robin 2011:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=2))

> "'Biodiversity' here includes species diversity, genetic diversity and ecosystem diversity, as deined by the peak expert group, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Farnham 2007: 2). The IUCN, originally founded in 1948, claims to be the world's irst 'global environmental organization'." ([Robin 2011:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=2))


> "It is a major authority on biodiversity. 'Species richness (the number of species in a given area) represents a single but important metric that is valuable as the common currency of the diversity of life', its website states, but it also considers genetic diversity and ecosystem diversity as part of its brief. The central argument of this paper is that a crisis itself frames its own solution" ([Robin 2011:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=2))

MAIN ARGUMENT

 ([note on p.26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=2))

> Biological diversity is a construct of the discipline of biology, usually ecology, genetics or evolutionary biology.

> biodiversity may be simultaneously both a scientiic and a social tool, and a key concept for science, management and governance

> "Biodiversity is a framework for understanding both 'the phenomenon of life' and the impact the activities of humans put on it. While the term biodiversity carries a veneer of scientiic independence, its emergence as a 'buzzword' in the 1980s was because of its usefulness in environmental activist circles: it became more than a mere measure of nature: it became a moral entreaty to respond to the 'environmental crisis' that was understood and deined in terms of loss of natural variety. (Farnham 2007)." ([Robin 2011:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=3))

biodiversity precisely as the product of the need to understand the relationship of humans to environment > not an analytic concept, but a political motivation. [biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation](biodiversity%20is%20not%20an%20analytic%20concept%20but%20a%20political%20motivation.md)



 ([note on p.27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=3))

> The next major step was to make biological diversity urgent, rather than merely descriptive.

> "The next major step was to make biological diversity urgent, rather than merely descriptive. A new sub-discipline, conservation biology, emerged in the 1980s, which founder Michael Soulé (1985) dubbed a 'science of crisis'. In this moment of crisis, the media-friendly term 'biodiversity' emerged." ([Robin 2011:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=3))

> "Biological diversity had been used as a political concept before: for example, it was used in parliament in defence of wild country in the Little Desert, in Australia in 1969. (Robin 1998). But biodiversity had a grand 'international moment' when the ecological crisis met politics in the United States, and its applications became increasingly global, with funding from national governments, international lobby groups and non-government organisations." ([Robin 2011:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=4))

Early political interaciton of biological diversity: late 1960s.



 ([note on p.28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=4))

> "When 'experts' like Wilson coin the term biodiversity, and then the term shapes deines the understanding of 'the environmental crisis', there is some basis for David Takacs's strong assertion that biodiversity became a 'tool for a zealous defense of a particular social construction of nature' in the 1980s. This term was undoubtedly a claim for power by conservation biologists (Takacs 1996: 1-2, [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md)). But if we are to understand the full international implications, and to get beyond the narrowly North American frame adopted by Farnham, Takacs and the self-proclaimed biodiversity experts themselves, it is helpful to historicise and internationalise the nature of the environmental crisis itself and step outside the white hot politics of the 1980s." ([Robin 2011:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=4))

BEYOND expertise and boundary-making —> what exactly?





 ([note on p.28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=4))

> "There were a series of environmental crises in the western world that shaped the relations between ecological science, natural resource management and environmental politics in the half-century between the 1930s and the 1980s. Here, I consider just three of these, in roughly chronological order: desertiication, the national parks movement and environmental health." ([Robin 2011:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=4))

Other drivers beyond CB lust of power. 



 ([note on p.28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=4))

> "Desertiication is the crisis that drives a 'land ethic', promoted by Sears (1949) and more prominently by Aldo Leopold (1949). In the later edition of Deserts on the March, Sears went beyond soil conservation. He called for an integration of conservation and natural resources: rather than pressing  'for a solution of an individual problem'. He also considered the 'common pattern of relationships' between renewable natural resources argued for conserving the whole, including the people (Sears 1949: 165-6)." ([Robin 2011:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=5))

Land ethic appears again.

> "Some dust storms blew as early as the 1890s, but the 'dirty thirties' Dust Bowl of the United States provided additional impetus and a model for government response." ([Robin 2011:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=5))

1930 dust storms in the US drove need for governmental control / management.

 ([note on p.29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=5))

> "Soil conservation authorities were established soon after these storms in New South Wales (1938) and Victoria (1940)" ([Robin 2011:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=5))

> "In 1951, the United Nations launched an international program in Arid Zone Research (Robin 2007: 112-13). It aimed to halt 'desertiication', advocating science to restore ecological health to lands needed for food and ibre, particularly in Israel and India," ([Robin 2011:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=5))

> "Wilderness was an important part of national identity in the United States, most prominently expressed in the idea of a National Park as a place 'free from human interference' (Nash 1982). From the 1960s onwards, the national" ([Robin 2011:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=5))

> "park concept was part of a series of international events." ([Robin 2011:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=6))

> "Rachel Carson's best-selling book, Silent Spring was published in 1962, the year of the irst World" ([Robin 2011:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=6))

As appears in ‘Environment the history of an idea’. ([note on p.30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=6))

> "Carson's manifesto suggested the connection between loss of biological diversity and human health, and how this could occur quickly over a few short generations. Pesticides polluted the environment, then were 'biomagniied' as they moved up the food chain and down the generations. The idea of biomagniication lent weight to the idea of understanding whole ecosystems and how they worked: the pesticide that killed the 'pest' animal also killed its predator, and as it moved up the food chain became increasingly dangerous to 'top predators', including humans" ([Robin 2011:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MTCITMM2?page=6))
