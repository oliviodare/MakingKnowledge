# the value of 'biodiversity' is not given by science
#conceptnote #T-phil 

This is perhaps a clear insight provided by environmental historians and STS scholars working on the history of conservation biology and the meaning of 'biodiversity'. The main tenet is that there is no way to 'proof' (to use Paul and Anne Ehrlichs's term, [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), p. 35) using science the value of conserving biodiversity. We can perhaps use scientific tools to measure and assess biological diversity, but it is rather a 'deeply felt belief' (to use [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md)'s terms, p. 34) justified in the ethical notion that human rights of existence should be extended to non-human beings. 

Additionally, this insight is a more fundamental level claim and holds the idea that [biodiversity is not an analytic concept but a political motivation](biodiversity%20is%20not%20an%20analytic%20concept%20but%20a%20political%20motivation.md).
