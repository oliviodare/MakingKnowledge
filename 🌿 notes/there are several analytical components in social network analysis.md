# there are several analytical components in social network analysis
#conceptnote #T-historiography 

[social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md). To draw those relations, SNA establishes several compoments in those networks.  

### Components and some characteristics of a network

|   Variable     |  Definition  | ad
|:--------------|:-----------|
| **Network**			| Node+Edges     | 
| **Nodes**			| The individual component of the network (the unit of analysis)     | 
| **Edges**				| 		The connection between nodes	 | 
| **Degree of a node**			| Number of connection to other nodes     | 
| **Hubs**			| Nodes with high degreee than the average     | 
| **Degree distribution of a network**			|  The probability distribution of degree over the entire network    | 
| **Strong ties**			|  Relationships between nodes in a network, high degree of interaction, designed to hold in the long-term. Such connectivity is ensured by high investments (economic and social)   | 
| **Weak ties**			|  Lower degrees of interaction, needs less investment, can dissipate quickly    | 
| **Rich data**			|  Data characterised by a high number of attributes, heteregenous and refereing to multilevel relations, and highly contextualised, obtained (for instance) through "thick descriptions" of history   | 
| **Poor data**			|  Data defined by low number of attributes, uncontextualised and not very refined   | 


### Two kinds of network

|   *Variable*  |  *Definition*  | *Characteristics* | *Insight* | *Example* |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
|   *Variable*  |  *Definition*  | *Characteristics* | *Insight* | *Example* |
| **Scale-invariant networks**		| Networks whose degree distribution follows a power law (i.e., change in one variable by x factor produces a change by a constant y factor to another variable)     | Many hubs + there are many repeating patters  | Stable and Robust | The scientific community
| **Highly-centralised networks**			| No much redundancy    | There is one important hub | Fault-prone, not stable | ? |
