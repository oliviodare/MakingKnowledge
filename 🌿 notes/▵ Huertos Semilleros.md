## Reading notes

[the first report on the 'red de huertos semilleros' was authored by Pardos Carri√≥n alone](the%20first%20report%20on%20the%20'red%20de%20huertos%20semilleros'%20was%20authored%20by%20Pardos%20Carri%C3%B3n%20alone.md)

- **Collaboration INIA-ICONA**: "Red nacional de huertos semilleros"  
- **Aim**: "disponer de semillas de origen determinado, procedentes de √°rboles con caracter√≠sticas definidas, seleccionadas en funci√≥n de los fines buscados en las repoblaciones", "criterios para sleccionas los √°rboles sobresalientes"
- Definition of "huertos semilleros" ("seed orchards") by Zobel (1958): 
	- "genetically superior"  
	- avoiding external polination  
	- intensive gardening, frequent yields  
	- ease of manipulation
	- mechanisms: clones and seedlings  
  
Present in other countries, here aims at a practical review of what‚Äôs done in "more advanced countries", specially in reference to the Pin√°ceas family and with the aim of developing policies and being useful for forest technicians.

Need for keepig seed orchards generation after generation for improved and "maximum genetic gain" through "controlled crossbreading"  
  
  
**Tipes of seed orchards**  
- **production orchards**: objective is short-term production of large amount of seeds, with a lesser regard to improving or declining "genetic gains  
- **"scientific orcharcs or "tree banks"**: objective is developing an strategy for the betterment at the long-term through the production and research of a wide array of genotypes.  

[technical details of seed orchards ('huertos semilleros')](technical%20details%20of%20seed%20orchards%20('huertos%20semilleros').md)
  
These two types are embodied in the ICONA and INIA.

Other kinds of orchards (don‚Äôt get the difference):  
- huertos brinzales: from selected "mother trees" or from controlled pollination between selected genitors.  
- huertos clonales (cloning orchards): from the propagule (the material from any organism that can develop independently) of previously selected trees. (here used as synonim of production orchards)  
  
 
**Selecci√≥n de √°rboles sobresalientes: criterios a seguir**  
[√Årboles plus √°rboles fenot√≠picamente sobresalientes](technical%20details%20of%20seed%20orchards%20('huertos%20semilleros').md#√Årboles%20plus%20√°rboles%20fenot√≠picamente%20sobresalientes)

√Årboles "fenot√≠picamente sobresalientes" = √°rboles plus   
  
The future use of the forest repopulation will guide the selection criteria. The four main uses are: wood production, resine and secretion products, fruits, and cork, and the selection criteria will depend on these.

Specifics about the selection criteria, examples:  
- Intended future use: for resine ‚Äì> fenotype: "presi√≥n de exudaci√≥n"  
- Intended future use: for fruit ‚Äì> fenotype: abundant and frequent fruits for the pine tree, casta√±o, encina  
- Intended future use: for cork ‚Äì> alcornoque  
  
  
For wood, which is the most common use, these are the main fenotypic conditions:  
- fast growth  
- straight trunk with concentric and regular growth rings  
- few and short branches  
- small cup  
- moderated fruit production  
- Other‚Ä¶ like density, of freezing marks, etc

Other selection criteria may depend on the health of the forest, like the ability to sustain parasites or extreme climatic or soil conditions. Some of this fenotypic desiderata may hinder the selection based on production-based fenotypes, and that‚Äôs where hybridisation comes into place.

2 mechanisms of asexual reproduction of trees:  
- injerto (grafting): most used, but more costly
- enraizamiento de esquejes (rooting of cuttings): not always possible

**[Ubicaci√≥n](technical%20details%20of%20seed%20orchards%20('huertos%20semilleros').md#Ubicaci√≥n)  y establecimiento de los huertos: dise√±os experimentales**    
Main [aims](technical%20details%20of%20seed%20orchards%20('huertos%20semilleros').md#Aims) of the orchards:  
- maximum production of seed of high genetic and fisiological quality  
- as fast as possible  
- reasonable price

The location of the orchards is key:  
- proximity to the final destination of the seeds 
- area with "ecological affinity"avoid where there is frost, drought, and wind   
- soil must be fertile, with good drainige and with regular fertilisation  
- flat surfaces are better  
- avoid crosspolinization with same species or other species that can hibridise with  
- square spaces, orientation E-W, not smaller than 3/4 Ha. 
- adequate separation between the indidivuals (depending on the species)
