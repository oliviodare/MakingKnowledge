# there are several ways to analyse 'knowledge transmission'
#conceptnote #T-historiography 


In Renn's *The Evolution of Knowledge* (153-155), by Jürgen Renn, we find a chapter on 'knowledge economies', which has an interesting framework for analysing different ways knowledge 'moves', according to the extension and directionality of the transfer: 
- dissemenation,
- circulation, and
- globalization

But there are other analytic categories that may be useful for me.

- mediation, 
- directness, 
- intentionality, 
- durability,
- reproducibility,
- ownership
- ...

However, more concrete methods are those described in [2020-Renn](2020-Renn.md) as social network analysis, or more concrete epistemic network analysis.
