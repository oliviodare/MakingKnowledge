# The problem that DORA tackles is an problem of employment
#conceptnote #ðŸš«nonthesis

The aim of DORA is regulating and reforming scientific employment by changing the way science is assessed: "Funding agencies, institutions that *employ* scientists, and scientists themselves, all have a desire, and need, to *assess* the quality and impact of scientific outputs. It is thus imperative that scientific output is measured accurately and evaluated wisely."
 
DORA transmits a sense of urgency due to the fact that individual employment in research depends on outputs, and they defend the a need that the assesment for employment is done fairly. However, this specific relation is rarely explictly stated as such.
