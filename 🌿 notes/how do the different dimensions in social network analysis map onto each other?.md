# how do the different dimensions in social network analysis map onto each other?
#conceptnote #T-historiography 

Taking SNA as a method to analyse epistemic networks ([social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md)), there is one question that arose when I drew a graphic representations of [2020-Renn](2020-Renn.md)'s description of the SNA method.

For instance, is the shape of the network the same in all dimensions? In my representation, I assumed that it is, keeping the same general shape at the different dimensions, altering only the number of nodes at position, and sometimes even representing no node:

![](social%20network%20analysis%20applied%20to%20a%20theory%20of%20the%20evolution%20of%20knowledge_modified.jpg)

For example, we could say that my graphic representation describes the epistemic network of a given scientific community with 4 main reserach groups (social dimension, *red*). Here, I've represented it in such a way that each of the 4 main research groups has a different number and degree of materials (semiotic dimension, *blue*: papers, patents, machines, buildings). The mapping here is almost 1:1, with one of the social nodes not displaying any associated material node (see the inexistent node in the right). Finally, the semantic dimension follows the same shape: each research group has a slightly different semantic composition. For instance, most connected node in this dimension is the black dot at the bottom left, which could represent a widely-used concept by all the reserch groups.


My question is, is the (almost) 1:1 mapping assumption true? Should a multidimension system be represented with the same shape at the different levels of analysis? If so, does this mean that one of the dimensions is more dominant in establishing the other networks' shape? Or, in the contrary, should we represent the network *only* according to the relations *within* individual dimensions? If so, this would give rise to differently-shaped dimensions, so how do we map the relation between dimensions?
