# biodiversity is narrowed to species richness due to pragmatic constrictions of conservation biology
#conceptnote #T-phil 

The contexts in which species richness is defended as a good measure of biodiversity are those that take into account the constrictions of conservation biology, such as the financial constrictions in [2000-Myers et al](2000-Myers%20et%20al.md).

The constrictions are financial (limited resources), epistemic (species richness is a good-enough surrogate, according to [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md)), and of the practices (it's "readily recognizable").

Those constrictions make it so [one of the main issues of conservation biology is dealing with funding, which is dealt with by setting 'conservation priorities'](one%20of%20the%20main%20issues%20of%20conservation%20biology%20is%20dealing%20with%20funding,%20which%20is%20dealt%20with%20by%20setting%20'conservation%20priorities'.md)
