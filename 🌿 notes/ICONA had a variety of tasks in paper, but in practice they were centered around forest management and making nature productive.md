# ICONA had a variety of tasks in paper, but in practice they were centered around forest management and making nature productive

 ICONA was created in a rush, and was given plenty of responsibilities and power over a widespread array of nature-management tasks: [ICONA's tasks were varied](ICONA's%20tasks%20were%20varied.md). However, they actual practice was centered around forest management and still within the frame of earlier twentietch century forest engingeering: making the forest productive and "satisfy the needs of industry". The making of ICONA is said to have been a continuing of a nature management approach based on forest engineering, but under a different banner. The forest was seen as a source of material good for economic and industrial development. This narrow focus of ICONA's tasks are better understood by looking at [ICONA's political origins](ICONA's%20origins%20are%20poltical.md).
 
 The narrow focus towards making nature productive, while still being an institution tasked with conserving nature caused several paradoxes and tension. One of them is the conflicting relation between their task of protecting forest fires and their aim of making the forest productive by planting specific kind of fast-growing trees, which contributed to a sharp rise in forest fires (Castroviejo, García Martínez y Prieto 1985, pp. 25-27, from [2006-Ramos Gorostiza](2006-Ramos%20Gorostiza.md), footnote. 105, p. 127).
 
 In the context of making nature productive, the figure of the 'ingenieros de montes' was crucial, as [in Spain up to the 1990s, natural spaces where managed by governmental  bodies which administered mountains and forests ("montes")](in%20Spain%20up%20to%20the%201990s,%20natural%20spaces%20where%20managed%20by%20governmental%20%20bodies%20which%20administered%20mountains%20and%20forests%20("montes").md).
 
 The culmination of this situation is the dichotomy which presented in the 1980s: [La sensibilidad ecológica estaba enmarcada en una percibida dicotomía producción-conservació](La%20sensibilidad%20ecológica%20estaba%20enmarcada%20en%20una%20percibida%20dicotomía%20producción-conservació.md)
