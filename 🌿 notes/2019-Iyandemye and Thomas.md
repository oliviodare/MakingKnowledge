**Take-home message**: I would not want to take policy advice from this paper. It's hard to generalise as it provides with a very narrow notion of published literature. It provides data with a weak, not very thought-through explanation. It argues that it's just a matter of the researchers doing the right thing (publishing in OA) because they know how important it is, which does not take into account fee-waivers or other structural facilitatators of OA publishing.

## Abstract

> Open access publication rates have been steadily increasing over time. In spite of this growth, academics in low income settings struggle to gain access to the full canon of research litera- ture. While the vast majority of open access repositories and funding organizations with open access policies are based in high income countries, the geographic patterns of open access publication itself are not well characterized. In this study, we developed a computational approach to better understand the topical and geographical landscape of open access publi- cations in the biomedical research literature. Surprisingly, we found a strong negative correla- tion between country per capita income and the percentage of open access publication. Open access publication rates were particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa, but vastly lower in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. These effects per- sisted when considering papers only bearing authors from within each region and income group. However, papers resulting from international collaborations did have a higher percent- age of OA than single-country papers, and inter-regional collaboration increased OA publica- tion for all world regions. There was no clear relationship between the number of open access policies in a region and the percentage of open access publications in that region. To under- stand the distribution of open access across topics of biomedical research, we examined key- words that were most enriched and depleted in open access papers. Keywords related to genomics, computational biology, animal models, and infectious disease were enriched in open access publications, while keywords related to the environment, nursing, and surgery were depleted in open access publications. This work identifies geographic regions and fields of research that could be priority areas for open access advocacy. The finding that open access publication rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa and low income countries sug- gests that factors other than open access policy strongly influence authorsâ€™ decisions to make their work openly accessible. The high proportion of OA resulting from international collabora- tions indicates yet another benefit of collaborative research. Certain applied fields of medical research, notably nursing, surgery, and environmental fields, appear to have a greater propor- tion of fee-for-access publications, which presumably creates barriers that prevent research- ers and practitioners in low income settings from accessing the literature in those fields.




## Highlights and notes

Two questions before reading (*and my thoughts after reading*)
- What about comparing middle-income to low-income countries? There may be waivers for south-saharan africa, but what about middle-income countries like the Lationamerican countries? *It addresses this, making it clear that waivers may be an important driver of OA in low-income countries and unavailable in middle-income countries:*
	 > Notably, many OA journals only offer full fee waivers for low income countries; itis possible that partial fee waivers are insufficient to incentivize authors from middle income countries to submit their work to OA journals.
- What sort of journals do researchers in low-income countries publish? *This is not addressed, and should. Are they publishing in so-called predatory journals, journals with low impact factors, etc? It's not enough with publishing, but publishing somewhere were your colleagues will read you.*



> It is generally believed that open access tracks with development [13] and that the Western world leads the OA movement due to technology and amore supportive publishing environment [14]. It has been speculated that publication fees, which are more common for OA papers, could have an inhibitory effect on OA publication by authors from low income countries [8,15], though such an inhibitory effect might be offset by fee waivers frequently granted to authors from these countries. Based on this confluence of factors, the prediction that OA publication rates are lower in low income countries than other countries seems very reasonable. (Iyandemye and Thomas, 2019, p. 2) 

This is what is generally believed: that OA publishing is generally lower in low-income countries due to economic reasons.


> The size of each point isproportional to the log2-transformed number of publications. (Iyandemye and Thomas, 2019, p. 5)

This is quite ridiculous tbh... Policy cannot be advised on data that does not take size of published science into account. Log2? Why?


> Interestingly, the pattern of OA publication does not match the pattern of OA policies instituted by funders, institutions, and governments. Sub-Saharan Africa has alow number of OA policies, but the highest percentage of OA publication of any region (Table 2). On the other hand, the two regions with the fewest OA policiesâ€”South Asia and the Middle East & North Africaâ€”have the lowest percentage of OA publication. These results suggest acomplex and non-linear relationship between OA policy and OA publication. (Iyandemye and Thomas, 2019, p. 6)

This seems interesting, but at the same time, what counts as 'policy' may be narrow. There must be something making sub-saharan african researchers publish in OA: is the author implying that it's because the individuals simply 'want' to publish in OA?


> The percentage of OA publication was highest in low income countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which has few OA policies and repositories, suggesting that factors in addition to OA policies play amajor role in authorsâ€™ decisions to publish OA papers. We also observed a consistent effect of international and inter-regional collaboration: papers with authors based in multiple countries or regions had asubstantially higher percentage of OA publication than their single-country and single-region counterparts. (Iyandemye and Thomas, 2019, p. 7)

I guess the reason why multicountries papers have higher rates of OA is because they have more opportunities to find relevant funding sources to make them OA.


> We hypothesize that authors based in low income countries who routinely struggle to gain access to pay-to-view academic literature are motivated to make their work freely available to other researchers (Iyandemye and Thomas, 2019, p. 7)

I find this hard to believe. He seems to be arguing that it's just the fact that they struggle what enables them to publish in OA, which does not account for the actual economical difficulties in publishing OA.


> Notably, many OA journals only offer full fee waivers for low income countries; itis possible that partial fee waivers are insufficient to incentivize authors from middle income countries to submit their work to OA journals. (Iyandemye and Thomas, 2019, p. 7)

This is very important. Little can be generalised from this study: 
- biased towards biomedical papers, 
- biased towards fields where OA is more common,
- it is not a linear representation of amount of published papers (see Figure1: size scale is not to scale)
