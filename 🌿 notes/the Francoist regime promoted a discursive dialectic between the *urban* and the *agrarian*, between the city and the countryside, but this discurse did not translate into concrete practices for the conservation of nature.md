# The Francoist regime promoted a discursive dialectic between the *urban* and the *agrarian*, between the city and the countryside, but this discurse did not translate into concrete practices for the conservation of nature
#conceptnote #T-histSpain

The peasant ('campesino') life and values were idealized, as opposed to the life of the city. However, this discurse did not translate into concrete practices for the conservation of nature. The National Parks and other areas that had been granted legal protection were were understaffed and underfunded.

The 'land rethoric' which elevated the life in the countryside and the uniqueness of Spanish nature was not new in Spain (it dates back to the late 19c), but during Franquism it became part of the official rethoric, although the regime was in fact more invovled in promoting industry than protecting nature and rural life. This is an important context to understand the [legal framework of nature conservation developed in Spain during the Francoist regime](what%20is%20the%20legal%20framework%20of%20conservation%20in%20Spain%20and%20Europe?.md). Studying (only) the laws may give a partial description of what actually took place, like for instance, thinking that because the [Decreto-Ley 17/1971](biodiv--rough%20list%20of%20events.md#1971%20making%20of%20ICONA) gave ICONA a lot of responsabilities, we need to take also into account that [ICONA had a variety of tasks in paper, but in practice they were centered around forest management and making nature productive](ICONA%20had%20a%20variety%20of%20tasks%20in%20paper,%20but%20in%20practice%20they%20were%20centered%20around%20forest%20management%20and%20making%20nature%20productive.md).
