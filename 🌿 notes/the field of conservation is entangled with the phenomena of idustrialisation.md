# the field of conservation is entangled with the phenomena of idustrialisation

While it is true that [conservation biolgy is a mission-driven science](conservation%20biolgy%20is%20a%20mission-driven%20science.md) and that [conservation biologists are aware and critical of industrialisation](conservation%20biologists%20are%20aware%20and%20critical%20of%20industrialisation.md), the relation between the two historical process (which do have very different timescales) is much more **entangled**. 

 While the history of conservation biology may seem at first glance to be a the history of a community of scientists working together against the deletirous effects of industrialisation in nature, the reality is much more complex. The two processes – on the one hand, the historical making of the ethos, practices, and social structures of the field of conservation biology; and on the other, the process of industrialization – are deeply entangled. In [2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md), we see how not all conservation effort achieved its main intention (reducing the destruction of biodiversity). The case she describes is an example of how a technological solution (here seed banks) are dependent and contribute to an industrial approach to agriculture that itself is a driver of decreased biodiversity.

> For example, this brief glance at the history of seed banking calls attention to the entanglement of industrial agriculture and global efforts to conserve biological diversity. The former is typically characterized by its dependence on genetically uniform crops and its ecologically destructive methods, and the latter as a struggle to mitigate the ill consequences of these and other industrial activities that destroy diversity—a struggle against the very forces that set global industrialized agriculture in motion. But industrial agriculture not only generated certain conservation concerns, it was also dependent (or its advocates came to see it as dependent) on conservation activities and tools.

This 'entanglement' is an instance of the late-modern concept of 'reflexivity', concretely how [seed banks are 'agricultural technologies' and 'conservation tools'](seed%20banks%20are%20'agricultural%20technologies'%20and%20'conservation%20tools'.md).
