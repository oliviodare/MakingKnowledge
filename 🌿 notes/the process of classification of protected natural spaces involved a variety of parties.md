 In the making of [any of the natural spaces of interest](The%20Ley%2015-1975%20established%20rules%20for%20the%20classification%20of%20areas%20into%20a%20set%20of%20"protected%20natural%20spaces".md)seemed to involve, at least on paper ([▵ Ley 15-1975](▵%20Ley%2015-1975.md)), on a variety of groups of actors: it seems as though the Ministry of Agriculture recevied reports from the Comisión Interministerial del Medio Ambiente as well as some Syndicates (such as the Hermandad Sindical Nacional de Labradores y Ganaderos) and other organisations (Corporaciones Locales, Cámaras Oficiales Sindicales Agrariasl, and Hermandades Sindicales Locales) are involved. As well, for the making of the "Reservas Integrales" it was also needed scientific reports vouching for their value. 
 
 In this process, lands could be expropiated (and payed damages to owners). Also, external parties would be able to file appeals (administrative or court cases) against the resolutions of the Ministry.
