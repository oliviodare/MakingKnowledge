# ecological assessment in ICONA was done through filling forms, and simplicity was emphasized

This 'simplicity principle' was explicitly stated in [▵ Circular nº1-1989. Estimación de posibles impactos ambientales de las restauraciones de la cubierta vegetal](▵%20Circular%20nº1-1989.%20Estimación%20de%20posibles%20impactos%20ambientales%20de%20las%20restauraciones%20de%20la%20cubierta%20vegetal.md) and was clear by the use of forms.

Following the idea that [ecological assessments in ICONA were done according to "their own judgment" and economic viability was a priority](ecological%20assessments%20in%20ICONA%20were%20done%20according%20to%20"their%20own%20judgment"%20and%20economic%20viability%20was%20a%20priority.md), the material practice of evaluation was unique too. 

The implementation of ecological knowledge and sensibility into ICONA had to be adapted to the practices and local knowledge of the ingenieros de montes. That's why they sent around several memos ([Circular nº1-1989](▵%20Circular%20nº1-1989.%20Estimación%20de%20posibles%20impactos%20ambientales%20de%20las%20restauraciones%20de%20la%20cubierta%20vegetal.md), [Circular Nº1-1983](▵%20Circular%20Nº1-1983.%20Normas%20complementarias,%20de%20carácter%20ecológico,%20a%20tener%20en%20cuenta%20en%20los%20proyectos%20y%20propyestas%20de%20repoblación.md)) The collection of data had to be simple and intuitive. They used two forms: CAE-1 y CAE-2. The idea was that evaluation would follow the guidelines stated in several memos "without needing more precision than what's needed to justify the project from an environmental point of view" ("El estudio no necesitará más precisión que la indispensable para justificar, desde el punto de vista ambiental, la ejecución del proyecto", [memo 1989](▵%20Circular%20nº1-1989.%20Estimación%20de%20posibles%20impactos%20ambientales%20de%20las%20restauraciones%20de%20la%20cubierta%20vegetal.md)). An example would be to use range of values instead of exact values.

After this assesent, representation of the ecological impact was done through [images](ecological%20impact%20in%20ICONA%20was%20represented%20(among%20other%20ways)%20by%20images%20of%20the%20same%20place,%20years%20apart.md) and graphs.
