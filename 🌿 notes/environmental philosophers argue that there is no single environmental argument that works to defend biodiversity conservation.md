# environmental philosophers argue that there is no single environmental argument that works to defend biodiversity conservation
#conceptnote #T-phil 

There are several arguments for the defence of biodiversity, which forms one of the major axis of the debate of environmental philosophers, environmentalists, and conservation biologists. According to [2020-Linquist, Varner and Newman](2020-Linquist,%20Varner%20and%20Newman.md) in their book *Defending biodiversity: environmental science and ethics* (2007), we can divide them in two camps, sort of as [two different ideal type approaches to Nature](what%20are%20the%20different%20ideal%20type%20approaches%20to%20Nature%20in%20conservation%20biology%20and%20related%20fields?.md)


- INSTRUMENTAL
	- ecosystem stability and functioning, 
	- provision of food, fibers and medicines (bioprospecting), 
	- nature-based tourism. 
- INTRINSIC
	- animal rights and environmentalism,
	- land-ethic eco-holism (*Ã  la Leopold*),
	- aesthetic values. 

They argue two things:
1. That these two camps are based on "traditional western ethical frameworks" that put humans and not nature as morally responsible and significant. 
2. No one argument works for all.
