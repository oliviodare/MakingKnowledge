# during the early Franquism, nature conservation movements were unliked from the previous scientific efforts

During the Francoist regime in Spain, specially in its first phase, there was an unlinking of scientific knowledge and practices from the conservation movement, characterised by a **dismantling of institutions** (like the Instituto Libre de Enseñanza) and **cleansing of non-supporters** (from the Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales, Sociedad Española de Historia Natural), leading to many naturalist either going to exile or not being able to continue their pre-war science-based conservation activities. ([2006-Ramos Gorostiza](2006-Ramos%20Gorostiza.md), p. 108).

As a telling example, the project of mapping and cataloguing nature stopped. The Mapa Geológico de España (1:50.000), which started in 1928, and the _Fauna Ibérica_ and _Flora Ibérica_, which started in 19194 and 1919 stopped and didn't continue until the 1980s.
