# not all environmental conflicts have been historically been framed as such, and before the late 20c were often framed as social conflicts

Before the late twentieth century ([2001-Martínez Alier](2001-Martínez%20Alier.md) situates it around the 1980s), social tensions that we would now caracterise as 'environmental conflicts' were not considered as such. If we go back in time, [the forerunner ecological movements were born as rural environmental justice movements and as urban and forestry management movements, not as movements for the conservation of wildlife](the%20forerunner%20ecological%20movements%20were%20born%20as%20rural%20environmental%20justice%20movements%20and%20as%20urban%20and%20forestry%20management%20movements,%20not%20as%20movements%20for%20the%20conservation%20of%20wildlife.md). However, this is not only a matter of historical cases, but in more recent and contemporary cases, the actors involved the the conflict themselves do not recognise themselves as 'environmentalists' or 'ecologists'. Martínez Alier brings forward the case of ecuatorian women fighting agains copper mines in Intag, who do not identify as ecologists or environmentalists ("Estas triunfantes mujeres locales rechazan hasta hoy en día que ellas sean ecologistas o ambientalistas, o, Dios lo remedia, ecofeministas.<sup>2</sup>", [2001-Martínez Alier](2001-Martínez%20Alier.md), p. 293).
