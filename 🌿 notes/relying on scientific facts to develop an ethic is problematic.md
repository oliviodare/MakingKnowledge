# relying on scientific facts to develop an ethic is problematic
#conceptnote #T-phil 

Scientific facts are not stable ("sometimes wrong", as [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) puts it).

One example is of Leopold's relyiance on the 'fact' of the correlation (and almost identification) between biological diversity and ecological stability. This 'fact' (among other elements, some non-scientific<sup>[!](#footnotes)</sup>) justified Leopold's defence of biodiveristy, but it turn out to not be such a 'fact'. The problematic is precisely to derive non-contingent ethic and values from the contingent enterprise of deriving facts from science: "Both facts and valuers are open to debate; both lie within the ecologists' ambit." (p. 15)

The 'diversity-stability hypothesis' was pervasive in late twentieth century-ecologists. This is also the case of [David Ehrenfeld](1996-Takacs.md#David%20Ehrenfeld), who "like Leopold, Elton, and Carson, [...] relied heaviliy on the tight interlocking between biological diversity and community stability. This theme pervaces his book, although he would later describe it as 'vewing and embarassing', noting that the diversity-stability hyptoheiss 'turned out to be a rallying point for conservationists who wished to justify with scientific reasons their original emotional desire to protect the full richness fo Nature, including the apparently useless majority of species.'<sup>73</sup>"

## The question is: what role should science and scientific facts play in developing a given ethic?

Or otherwise put ([1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), p. 15): 

## "How can one ever extricate what the natural world really tells us from what we wish the natural world told us?"

## footnotes
Leopold was a pluralist, and used a plethora of arguments. As in [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) (p. 16):
> Leopold knew that his was not the final word, but merely the prolegomena to a new synthesis. Like many who came after him, Leopold was a pluralist; he used many arguments or styles to make his case, so that he might convert as many readers as possible.
