> "In this intellectual history of the concept from three environmental historians, the last seven decades are seen as having brought a radical change in human understanding and making of the environment. The Environment seeks to illuminate and unpack the term and suggest where human cognisance may take us in the future." ([Honeybun-Arnolda 2019:1010](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=1))

> "1940s began to conceptualise the environment as global, interconnected and subject to human force." ([Honeybun-Arnolda 2019:1010](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=1))

> "then move on to the 1960s and 1970s when the idea of the environment became institutionalised, emerging as the focus for multiple national and transnational agencies and beginning to be regularly discussed as a topic in academic conferences" ([Honeybun-Arnolda 2019:1010](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=1))

> "We are taken on a journey through the development of concepts such as ecosystem, biosphere, biological diversity and anthropogenic climate change that are now commonplace and have their own intellectual history, converging into the overall narrative and broad idea of the environment." ([Honeybun-Arnolda 2019:1010](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=1))

*A political history combined with the development of concepts ([note on p.1010](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=1))*

 
 
 
 
 

> "The authors do recognise these multiple ideas and actors and the historical contexts accompanying them and they unravel the complex history of the idea of the environment almost seamlessly. In doing so, they highlight that the evolution of the environment is principally based on the emergence of new expertise. But, they do not offer any deconstruction of 'expertise', what it means to be an expert, nor do they delve deeper into the methods by which the legitimacy or authority of this new expertise are secured." ([Honeybun-Arnolda 2019:1010](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=1))


> "Although this was not the central task nor is it traditionally a task of the historian, the need for a deeper understanding of the role of experts and for contextualising expertise and the role of political institutions, cultures and societies in producing, regulating, negotiating and legitimising expertise in the shaping of the environment as an idea became increasingly evident as the book progressed." ([Honeybun-Arnolda 2019:1011](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GZRWRXD?page=2))
