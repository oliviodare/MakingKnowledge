# ecological assessments in ICONA were done according to "their own judgment" and economic viability was a priority
#conceptnote #T-ICONA #T-ecology 


The memo 1/1987 aimed at taking in the 1986 decree, but also to develop the ICONA "own judgement" ("criterio propio") of the environemntal consequences of its projects, and so that it could decide, "under its responsibility" ("bajo su responsabilidad") whether a project should or shouldn't continue. 

One of the principles they uphel was the "economic principle" (principio de economia): that the extra effort of making the project in line with the environmental directives should be "minimum"and "reasonable" ("el mínimo posible y, en todo caso, razonable").

This emphasis on economic viability is a product of [ICONA's productivism origins](ICONA's%20work%20was%20embedded%20in%20the%20autarkic%20and%20productivist%20political%20aims%20of%20Franquism.md) and the fact that [they framed their ecologic sensibility within a perceived dichotomy productivity-conservation](La%20sensibilidad%20ecológica%20estaba%20enmarcada%20en%20una%20percibida%20dicotomía%20producción-conservació.md)
