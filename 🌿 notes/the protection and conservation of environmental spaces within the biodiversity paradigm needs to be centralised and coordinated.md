# the protection and conservation of environmental spaces within the biodiversity paradigm needs to be centralised and coordinated
#conceptnote #T-histenvir 


In the case of Europe, the Natura 2000 network is the tool that carries such coordination, together with the European Directiva de Aves (1979) and the Directiva de HÃ¡bitats (1992) acting as the enforcing laws of a centralised biodiversity paradigm.

Perhaps 'needs' is a strong word here, but we can definitely say, that the protection of nature (or its management, more broadly) have been, since the 1970s and the rise of the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md) being institutionalised, typically managed by central governments (in a top-down manner, as illustrated by [2018-Gil Farrero](2018-Gil%20Farrero.md): [there are two ways to manage natural resources, top-down or bottom-up](there%20are%20two%20ways%20to%20manage%20natural%20resources,%20top-down%20or%20bottom-up.md).
