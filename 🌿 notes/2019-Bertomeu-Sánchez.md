## Reading notes



> Drawing on previous studies of agriculture and fascism, I explore a group of pesticides – lead arsenates – which were introduced under the aegis of the early Francoist policies that sought to bring together agriculture and industry.



> The politics of autarky played an important role both as an ideological goal (self-sufficiency) and as a response to a specific economic situation (commercial isolation) caused by the shortage of imported raw materials. Many Francoist politicians were persuaded that self-sufficiency could only be obtained by means of a centralized authoritarian regime able to enforce more effective practices in agriculture and at the same time promote the intensive exploitation of mineral resources and the development of national industry. In this process, the role of experts such as engineers in mining, public works and agriculture was seen as crucial.

 Autarky and its two interraltated economic dimensions (self-sufficiency and commercial isolation) are a relevant political/economic context for my thesis as it deals with the use of natural resources. [the politics of autarky in Spain are an important context to understand the management of natural resources](the%20politics%20of%20autarky%20in%20Spain%20are%20an%20important%20context%20to%20understand%20the%20management%20of%20natural%20resources.md)




> With these issues in mind, the present paper focuses on the role of agricultural engineers in the emergence of this “pesticide treadmill.” Before offering a collective portrayal, in the first section I describe other expert groups interested in pest control in early twentieth-century Spain: forest engineers, entomologists, and public health physicians. I also review the reluctance of farmers to adopt the new pesticides in these early years. The next section discusses how agricultural engineers established themselves as the most powerful expert group in pest control during the first years of the Francoist regime.

 There were many expert groups interested in pests and pesticides, but the agricultural engineers established themselves as the most relevant and powerful.

> Early twentieth-century Spanish agriculture tends to be described as backward, archaic, inefficient, and unproductive. Among the reasons usually mentioned are the limited use of machinery and agrochemicals. Scarce attention has been paid to technological changes before the 1960s, when the combined effects of economic development and the Green Revolution are believed to have produced a new scenario, in which Spain became one of the European countries with the highest levels of pesticide use at the beginning of the twenty-first century.10 In recent decades this dominant view has been reassessed by new research on the history of Spanish agriculture which takes into account environmental constraints, regulatory frameworks, additional economic factors, social processes of decision-making, and regional variations. Additional historical actors have been taken into account with reference to the introduction of new seeds, inputs, techniques and practices in the broad range of social contexts and agricultural ecosystems in the Iberian Peninsula.11 This revised view of technological change is also important when dealing with the advent of arsenical pesticides. In this case, the “backwardness” narrative has its roots in the writings of early twentieth-century agricultural engineers who lamented the scarce use of fertilizers and pesticides in Spain. They also celebrated the massive arrival of lead arsenate in their country in the 1940s, some decades after its first application in the United States and Canada, and at a time when it was in common use in France and other European countries.12

 The historical characterization of 'backwardness' is itself product of the historical time where modernity/backwardness was under construction and promoted by the historical actors who pushed for modern reforms in agriculture. [The new historiography of spanish agricultural history questions the concept of 'backwardness' and contributes to descriptions of how that concept came about](The%20new%20historiography%20of%20spanish%20agricultural%20history%20questions%20the%20concept%20of%20'backwardness'%20and%20contributes%20to%20descriptions%20of%20how%20that%20concept%20came%20about.md).

> The first references to lead arsenate in Spanish agronomic literature date from around 1910. It was applied against pests affecting a variety of crops such as grapes, olives and apples during the 1920s and 1930s, but its use remained very limited until 1940, when Colorado beetles arrived in Spain. In fact, it was during the first years of the Franco regime that arsenical pesticides were introduced on a massive scale in Spain, due to the issues I will discuss in the following pages.

 Against the standard narrative of Spain being technologically backwards, the Francoist regime promoted the use of technologies such as pesticides. 

> Their work, however, was seriously affected by the Civil War, as many of them faced political repression or were forced into exile. Using the entomologic collections and libraries of these scientists, the new Francoist regime created a new institute (Instituto Español de Entomología) in 1941, under the direction of a forest engineer, Gonzalo Ceballos. The broad-ranging, general approach that had characterized the centre in its early days was now replaced by a narrow focus on forest pest control by means of pesticides and aerial fumigations during the 1940s and 1950s.


[Their work = the work of the first Spanish entomologists, like Ignacio and Cándido Bolivar, who belonged to the National Museum of Natural History].  


There was a narrowing in the focus towards forest pest control.

> Daniel Nagore, an agricultural engineer who ran a large spraying campaign against sugar beet pests in 1923, found that farmers were frightened by the “mortal effects” of arsenic and that some of them were familiar with the French legal restrictions concerning its use in agriculture.25 Another agricultural engineer, José Cruz Lapazarán, who frequently offered advice on arsenical spraying in agronomic journals during the 1920s, wrote a long answer in a trade newspaper to the concerns expressed by farmers. He offered many technical details on the chemical analysis of sprayed fruits, concluding that the quantities of arsenic detected in apples were so small that they could not be harmful to humans or animals. According to Lapazarán, the concerns with arsenical compounds in agriculture were merely “products of the rural imagination,” which was always prone to equate innovation with evil.26



> In 1928, Pedro Hercé, an agricultural engineer whose work focused on pesticide quality control, complained of the limited use of pesticides in Spanish agriculture, while acknowledging an increase in their consumption in the past few years.



> He called for experimental studies on these pesticides and, in fact, throughout the 1920s and 1930s he and other colleagues performed many experiments with different mixtures of arsenates.30 Hercé’s views on quality control were moulded according to the US regulations of the beginning of the twentieth century.31 Many other agricultural engineers supported the regulation of these products, along the lines of the US model; in Spain, several minor controls were implemented in the 1920s and 1930s but the most important ones were introduced in the early 1940s, just after the Spanish Civil War.

 Public discussion in newspapers and the reticence of farmers to use arsenic pesticides, as well as studies by agricultural engineeriners, led to regulation of pesticide products in the 1920, 30s, and most strongly in the 1940s.

> In the previous sections, we have seen that pest control management during the first decades of the twentieth century involved several different expert communities: agricultural and forest engineers, general and economic entomologists, and public health physicians. Among them, agricultural engineers attained the major role in pest control during the early years of the Francoist Regime. With its roots in nineteenth-century agronomic research, Spanish agricultural engineering gained momentum at the beginning of the twentieth century thanks to the Pest Control Act (1908), the opening of new teaching centres, the development of the National Institute for Agronomic research, the founding of research field stations (including several “Granjas experimentales” and “Estaciones Fitopatólogicas”), and the consolidation of a network of provincial agricultural sections led by an agricultural engineer. By the mid-1930s, just before the Spanish Civil War, some 400 agricultural engineers were appointed in these different positions, making this one of the most numerous engineering corps in Spain. Apart from their involvement in pest control, agricultural engineers played a major part in testing new inorganic fertilizers, running research on plant breeding, and introducing new seeds and agricultural machinery – the key issues, in their eyes, in the process of the “modernization” of Spanish agriculture.33


Spanish agricultural engineerings gained a lot of power through different means in the first third of the 20c.  


I also may want to look more closely to this "Granjas experimentales" and "Estaciones Fitopatológicas" and if they had any involvement with creating seed banks. #🟡casestudies

> The period of the Second Republic (1931-1936) was a difficult one for the agricultural engineers. On the one hand, they were compelled to participate in the social debates concerning agriculture, in particular in the debates on land ownership and the Agrarian Reform Act. This involvement questioned the idea of their “technical neutrality,” one of the pillars of the corps’ public image.

 The neutrality of the knowledge of agricultural engineers, which was their flagship, was put into question during the Second Republic. [the legitimacy of knowledge kinds is co-constructed with the political contexts in which it develops](the%20legitimacy%20of%20knowledge%20kinds%20is%20co-constructed%20with%20the%20political%20contexts%20in%20which%20it%20develops.md)

> In addition to their role in the introduction of pesticides, many agricultural engineers also carried out research in alternative forms of pest control, particularly in plant breeding (new varieties more resistant to pests or plant diseases) and biological control (for instance, the introduction of natural parasites of the insects). The entomologists mentioned above such as Ricardo García Mercet and Ignacio Bolívar and his son Cándido Bolívar, sometimes in collaboration with agricultural engineers, also popularized many biological methods, including the introduction of microorganisms, poisoning fungi, or predatory insects.37 In several stations, for instance in Burjassot (València), agricultural engineers performed field experiments designed to acclimatize the natural parasites of bugs affecting citrus trees such as Planococcus citri (citrus mealybug) and other pests such as Icerya purchasi (cottony cushion scale) or Chrysomphalus dyctiospermi (red scale). In Barcelona, similar studies were developed against apple aphids, employing the parasitoid Aphelinus mali, which was also mobilized in campaigns in A Coruña, València and the Basque Country during the 1930s.

> While famous entomologists such as Cándido Bolivar were forced into exile, most of the agricultural engineers remained in Spain and were able to pursue successful careers: only a small number (around ten percent) suffered political persecution. The rest remained in Spain and cooperated, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, with the new Francoist regime. In fact, their role in politics increased, particularly in areas related to agriculture. Two ministers of agriculture (Carlos Rein Segura and Rafael Cavestany) were agricultural engineers, while the head of the service of agriculture Manuel Goytia Angulo was a member both of the Falange (the fascist party) and of the Spanish parliament.39 The reform of the National Institute of Agronomic Research in February and March 1940 established a large, centralized network under the control of agricultural engineers, comprising experimental farms, phytopathological stations, horticultural centres, agro-chemistry laboratories, wine, rice and olive research stations, and so on.

 The agricultural engineers were highly connected to institutions of political power.

> The beetles were a particular source of alarm because of the increasing significance of potato production in Spanish agriculture, which had become the second most important crop (after wheat) in the years before the Civil War. According to the report by the agricultural engineer José María Díaz de Mendivil, potato production had risen from 3.1 million tonnes in 1910 to 48 million tonnes in 1936, thanks to a similar increase in cultivated land (while productivity per acre remained low). Like other agricultural engineers during the 1930s, Díaz de Mendivil worked on new potato seeds created by recent genetic research, performing field experiments in Iturrieta (Basque Country), where a research centre focused on potato breeding was set up, called the *Estación para la Mejora de la Patata*. The work of Díaz de Mendivil expanded in the early 1940s; thanks to his connections with the new authoritarian regime, he became an influential political leader in the Basque Country and was also appointed to key roles in institutions responsible for agriculture and, particularly, potato crops.46

> While encouraging potato production, the programme of “genetic modernism” was also a way to control rural populations and agricultural practices during the first years of the dictatorship: under the programme, labels and official certificates for seed potatoes (“patatas de siembra”) were introduced, permits were provided by the fascist trade unions, restrictions on the fields for cultivation were authorized by agricultural engineers, fines were imposed on recalcitrant potato breeders, practical courses were provided for farmers, quality controls were implemented, and fixed prices, taxes and subsidies were imposed.

 How modern agriculture was established, and its linked to  the authoritarian regime.

> In the 1940s, facing the policies of autarky and economic inactivity, Francoist politicians enlisted the help of agricultural engineers to devise substantial reforms in agriculture. These agrarian policies were largely based on State interventionism, corporatism (new farmers’ unions) and market regulation (fixed prices, sales quotas, and rationing).49

> the control of Colorado beetles required the active collaboration of farmers whose crops remained apparently unaffected by the pest, at least during the first weeks. Farmers were instructed to follow “with due discipline” the procedures established by agricultural engineers: they had to inspect carefully their fields and “urgently report” any evidence of the pest, even if they did not see any danger for their crops.

 Different knowledges, practices, and attitudes are 'forced' to interact in agriculture: scientific, farming, political.

> The example of the province of Burgos confirms that the programme for controlling the Colorado beetle pest was based on a combination of sociotechnological products (such as lead arsenate), expert advice (agricultural engineers), agropolitical propaganda and ruthless repression.

 A multi-level programme of control.

> One might have expected the scarcity of pesticides after the Civil War to encourage alternative methods for pest management: biological control, breeding and seed selection, or changes in crop production practices to reduce the likelihood of pest damage. In the previous sections, we have seen that these methods were well known in Spain during the 1930s; in fact, discussing pest control management in 1942, the director of the Madrid Experimental Field Station Miguel Benlloch recommended their use when chemical pesticides were not available.73 Benlloch foresaw an important role for biological methods in the future, but the dramatic circumstances of the 1940s and the “enormous economic damage” caused by insects meant that they could not “wait (for such) distant solutions.”



> Alternative methods for pest control were marginalized in the 1940s for reasons other than those mentioned by Moreno and Benlloch. Unlike biological control, the use of chemical pesticides upheld two of the cornerstones of early Francoist policies: economic self-sufficiency through the use of domestic raw materials (involving a more intensive use of mineral resources), and the development of national industry (in this case, in connection with agriculture). With its material and rhetorical ingredients, autarky helped to justify the new authoritarian regime and its policies of state intervention in the economy, particularly in the key areas of the pharmaceutical industry and food supply.

 The autarkic policies which favoured national industry (here, chemical industry and mining) helped visibilizide specific solutions (pesticides) and invisibilize others (biological solutions, breeding).

> For years, agricultural engineers had called for tighter regulations on fraud and adulteration. In 1940, they managed to set up a permanent programme for the “inspection of the production and commerce of insecticides.”82 Two years later, the National Register for Phytosanitary Products was created, just months before the establishment of a similar service in Vichy France. As in the French service, the priorities were intensive agricultural production and the development of the pesticide industry, rather than public health concerns.83 The register was designed to guarantee the quality of the pesticides: that is, that they should be effective against pests but harmless to plants. No information was requested regarding the hazards for animals, farmers,

> or consumers. The register aimed to encourage national production (a separate procedure was created for imported pesticides, with stricter requirements) as well as to prevent the trading of adulterated products and fakes, which incurred heavy fines. These forms of malpractice were seen as being particularly damaging to the new biopolitics implemented by the agricultural engineers.84



> The above section sheds light on the striking inequalities involved in the production of knowledge and ignorance regarding pesticides and their hazards in the early Francoist years. Public health doctors faced many difficulties recording epidemiological information, as they lacked the support of the legal or political authorities. And even when the data reported were alarming, as in the Pradoluengo accident, the medical evidence was ignored or resulted in insufficient public action to prevent the risks to consumers and farmers; in contrast, new research on pest quality control was very quickly used to introduce changes in the regulations.
