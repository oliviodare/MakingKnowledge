# the term 'biodiversity' is the scientized equivalent of 'nature' and 'wilderness' and a history of 'biodiversity' is a history of how scientists shaped the new meaning and attitudes towards the natural world

The making of 'biodiveristy' as a concept is the move from 'nature' and 'wilderness' to their scientized cousin concept: one that did not appear as local and contextual, that did not indicate (at least immediate) a relationship to class. 

Just as [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) (p. 106 for quotes) did for the history of 'biodiversity' in the EEUU, my project attempts to do the same in Spain: from 'montes' to 'biodiversidad', tracking the movements that took place in the last third of the twentieth century ([in Spain up to the 1990s, natural spaces where managed by governmental  bodies which administered mountains and forests ("montes")](in%20Spain%20up%20to%20the%201990s,%20natural%20spaces%20where%20managed%20by%20governmental%20%20bodies%20which%20administered%20mountains%20and%20forests%20("montes").md)).
