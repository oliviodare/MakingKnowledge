# nineteenth-c views on 'extinction' were characterised by a strong idea of the 'balance of nature', which conceptualised it as a fair, inevitable, and gradual phenomena

The rough history on the view of extinction, with main players and ideas.

1.  During the early 19c, there was a general **theological** understanding of plenitude, with the idea that God wouldn't create something inperfect or in vain.
    

2.  Georges **Cuvier**: he was the expection to the rule, and introduced the idea of "revolutions" and catastrohic mass extinctions. What was upsetting to mast naturalist was not that God _could_ be removed from the explanation, but that it negated the idea of 'balance of nature'. The 'balance of nature' paradigm was the most important tennet of 19c views on extinction. Cuvier's ideas were largely rejected.


4.  Charles **Lyell**: philosophy of uniformitarianism. While not believing in evolution, he proposed a theory of geology where the Earth changes slowly and makes species adapt. Those that don't adapt, get extinct and others arise. The one-to-one relation between geology and biology, made it possible to think of biological extinction to follow the slow mechanisms of geological changes.Â 
    
4.  **Darwin**. In comparison to Cuvier, he instead didn't reject the idea of 'balance of nature' in his theory of evolution. He took from Lyell's view and made natural selection (a slow process) to be the driving force of extinction. Within the Darwinian framework, natural selection (and by extension, extinction) was a zero-sum game, thus mantaining the 'balance of nature' proposition. 


This rendered an view on 'exctinction' as necessary for the stability of life, as a *positive* driving force for the betterment of species. On the other hand, 'biodiversity' was not an independent value in biology as we have today. we could even say that 'extinction' was that independent value that was
