# connecting [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md) with my case study

'Biodiveristy' may be hard to find in the archives: I need:
- a) a better analytic term, that can, for instance, be used to describe processes that came before the emergence of 'biodiversity' as such.  
- b) this analytic term will help find instances of this process (under different terms).


The idea of [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md) provides a useful research framework to connect the different analytic/historiographical questions with the questions, projects, and motivations of the historical actors themselves: see this [analytic sketch](analytic%20sketch.md).

The term 'biodiversity' is a neologism dating from a specific date [1986 National Forum on BioDiversity](biodiv--rough%20list%20of%20events.md#1986%20National%20Forum%20on%20BioDiversity). Tracing this word in the archives will be difficult if not a temporal impossibility. However, the emergence of the concept 'biodiversity' was not an isolated event, and its [reification](the%20reification%20of%20biodiversity%20was%20the%20late-20c%20process%20of%20recognising%20natural%20variety%20as%20a%20tangigle,%20valuable,%20and%20manageable%20entity.md) dates to social, scientific, political, and cultural processes that took place throughout the second half of the twentieth century. For instance [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md) argues that [in the 1970s, biological diversity was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'exctinction'](in%20the%201970s,%20biological%20diversity%20was%20revalorised,%20and%20in%20part%20due%20to%20new%20views%20on%20'exctinction'.md) by which the technical meaning of 'biodiversity' appeared, in which [ecological, sytem-based knowledge of living system](the%20technical%20meaning%20of%20'biodiversity'%20is%20the%20product%20of%20a%20new%20ecological,%20systems-based%20understanding%20of%20the%20natural%20environment.md)
 was necessary for any sort of intervention. Given the historical precedents to the term 'biodiversity', I may be able to trace instances of the '[endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md)' in the [ðŸ—„ Instituto para la ConservaciÃ³n de la Naturaleza (ICONA)](ðŸ—„%20Instituto%20para%20la%20ConservaciÃ³n%20de%20la%20Naturaleza%20(ICONA).md) archives.
