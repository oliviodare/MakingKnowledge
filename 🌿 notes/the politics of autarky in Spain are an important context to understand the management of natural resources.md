# the politics of autarky in Spain are an important context to understand the management of natural resources

Duringn the Francoist regime, [2019-Bertomeu-S치nchez](2019-Bertomeu-S치nchez.md) has argued, "The politics of autarky played an important role both as an ideological goal (self-sufficiency) and as a response to a specific economic situation (commercial isolation) caused by the shortage of imported raw materials." Autarky and its two interraltated economic dimensions (self-sufficiency and commercial isolation) are a relevant political/economic context for my thesis as it deals with the use of natural resources. One of the examples is ICONA, an institution which [had a variety of tasks in paper, but in practice they were centered around forest management and making nature productive](ICONA%20had%20a%20variety%20of%20tasks%20in%20paper,%20but%20in%20practice%20they%20were%20centered%20around%20forest%20management%20and%20making%20nature%20productive.md)

As an example, [2019-Bertomeu-S치nchez](2019-Bertomeu-S치nchez.md) points out in the face of complex problems that had a wide-range of social, political, economic, scientific, and technical implications, like pest and their control, the autarkic policies which favoured national industry (such as the chemical industry and mining) helped visibilizide specific solutions (pesticides) and invisibilize others (biological solutions, breeding).
