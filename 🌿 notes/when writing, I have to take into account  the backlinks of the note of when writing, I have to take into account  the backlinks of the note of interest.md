Connected to [thought-notes should have condensed titles and self-contained and referentiable content](thought-notes%20should%20have%20condensed%20titles%20and%20self-contained%20and%20referentiable%20content.md), but part of the writing process.

Let's say I'm working on writing a paragraph, based on [the politics of autarky in Spain are an important context to understand the management of natural resources](the%20politics%20of%20autarky%20in%20Spain%20are%20an%20important%20context%20to%20understand%20the%20management%20of%20natural%20resources.md). I should not only look at the outgoing links which are written on the text itself, but also the *backlinks*, which are present on side panel. **It's important thus to check the side panel, because otherwise I may miss important connections!**. I normally don't use it at the moment, but will be crucial for writing. The backlinks, as well as the outgoing links, are present in the graph view, but I may not onlways see them, specially in a highly-connected node.
