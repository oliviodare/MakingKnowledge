# what is the relation between iHPS approach and conceptual history?
#conceptnote #T-historiography 

I am unsure about their relation, as it seems it could be productive but not simply exchangable. 

The meaning of 'concept' in an iHPS approach refers to the philosophical analytical concept, while the meaning of 'concept' in a conceptual history approach seems to refer to the object of study situated historically. 

First, Kosselleck's conceptual history mirrors the ideal-type approach of Weber. The ideal types are generalisations of historical pecularities whose meanings are united in the context of a particular historical quesiton with a given analytical objective (e.g., in [1930-Weber](1930-Weber.md), the different approaches to work, or the different life ethics of the different sects of protestantism: lutherans, calvinists, methodists...). As such, the ideal types are objects of study which are situated historically. The problem that ideal types solve is that they allow for an analytic generalisation of peculiarities, and it solves the problem by bringing in the meaning that is sought after by the historian. 

By contrast, 'concept' as used by iHPS scholars seems to have a different meaning. It is the *philosophical* concept that they refer to. The problem that they try to solve is to empirically (i.e., historically) justify the framework that they are analysing philosophically. For instance, if the philosopher is interested on Kuhn's concept of 'scientific innovation', they may want to motivate this with several examples.
