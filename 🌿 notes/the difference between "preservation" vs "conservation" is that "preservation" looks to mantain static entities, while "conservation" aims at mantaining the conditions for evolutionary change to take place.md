# the difference between "preservation" vs "conservation" is that "preservation" looks to mantain static entities, while "conservation" aims at mantaining the conditions for evolutionary change to take place

Definition from Frankel and Soul√©, taken from [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md).

Together with this, the difference between "preservation" and "conservation" maps also the difference between, respectively, species-by-species approach and biodiversity approach to wildlife management: the former attends to keeping the "form" (preserving the species), while the latter cares about the evolutionary dynamics (the "formation" of species). This is from Rolston, also taken from [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md).
