# social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems
#conceptnote #T-historiography 

SNA can be used to track relations and dynamic changes of a network, itself composed of different levels. For instance, Renn's 'epistemic networks' are composed<sup>[!](#footnotes)</sup> of three other networks: semantic, semiotic, and social. SNA is the method by which we can analyse the changing relation between and within levels through history, for example, the relation between social and mental processes.

There's a further claim by Renn that SNA can also be used to analyse these relations in a quantitative manner, but I yet have to understand how exactly this is done.

## footnotes
<sup>!</sup>:  maybe 'composed' is not accurate enough, as the claim is not *only* a metaphysical claim about what the networks are made of. In my view, the relation between the larger epistemic network and the smaller ones (semantic, semiotic, and social) is both metaphysical (what these networks *are* in the natural world) and epistemic (how do we *analyse* theses networks).
