# seed banks represent an encyclopedic solution to the problem of diversity

[2017-Curry](2017-Curry.md) describes how [by the early mid twentieth century, there was a widespread fear of losing crop genetic diversity](by%20the%20early%20mid%20twentieth%20century,%20there%20was%20a%20widespread%20fear%20of%20losing%20crop%20genetic%20diversity.md). The answer of agriculturist (breeders and scientists) to this worry   was a sort of 'encyclopedic' answer: the preferred knowledge was a theoretical one (in the form of the bank where worldwide variety was kept secure and to which anybody could in principle at some point access in case of need), and not a practical one (the cultivation itself kept on going in the direction of industrial agriculture).

This 'encycloped solution' was not what [ICONA was looking for when talking about 'conservation', for them, it was about conserving its "potentiality](for%20ICONA,%20conserving%20Nature%20is%20conserving%20its%20"potenciality"..md)
