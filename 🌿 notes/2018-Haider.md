**Take-home message**: This article traces the history of the term 'open' through seminal pieces, manifestos, and reports about Open Access: the Budapest OA Initiatie (2001), Berlin Declaration (2003), the Finch report (2012), OA2020 Initiative (2015), and the European Commission‚Äôs 2016 publication on ‚ÄúOpen innovation, open science, open to the world ‚Äì a vision for Europe‚Äù. It traces several movements: 
1. the **narrowing of the problem** that OA is trying to solve: from inequality in access to research to a reframing of the publishing bussiness model (i.e., establishing gold OA, forgetting diamond OA)
2. the reframing of OA and OS concepts such as 'transparency' as **tools for accountability** of individual researchers,  
3. the **flip of the role of the individual researcher** in the OS movement: from the driver of change with agency and responsibility to the object that needs to change and the subject of surveillance. The individual is has come to be seen as the obstacle for change
4. the **association of OS as a tool for national competition in a paradigm of economic growth**

## Highlights and notes


> ‚ÄúIn a way, the rise of open science perplexes me and I have come to ask myself: if science is opened now, then how was it being closed before, by whom or by what?‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 2)

> ‚ÄúOften we are presented with a simple dichotomy, introducing a fault line between an open science on one side and a closed science on the other.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 2)

This is precisely the dichotomy that CS establishes and enforces.


> ‚ÄúYet, how is this imagined to be achieved? Already a superficial reading of the types of opening strategies that are thrown around in the debates, makes it quite obvious that the aspects of science that are seen as closed are not the ones that were challenged by for instance feminist, postcolonial or post-development science studies scholars in their powerful critiques over the last decades (9). Their work showed over and over how the knowledge regimes and epistemological bases of science are deeply implicated in society‚Äôs various oppressive strategies. This, as I have argued elsewhere, is not fundamentally questioned in the open access movement (7, 8), rather it is used as a scaffolding and nor is it challenged much ‚Äì it seems ‚Äì in open science.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 2)

At the very least, we see how OS is trying to 'open' science in a very particular way. While it's critical of some of the status quo of research (namely, paywalls and research misconduct), it does forget to 'open' and criticize many other problematics of research (namely, profit-making, surveillance, science-based discrimination).


> ‚ÄúIf open access and open science are the solutions, then what is the problem they are meant to solve?‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 2)

Beautiful question.


> ‚ÄúThis thread can also be seen in the way in which those who were the ones challenged by proponents of open access commercial publishers - have in significant arenas come to represent and exemplify open access and open science. They do this not in the form of a counterproposal but as an appropriation (see also 6, 11).‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 3)

OA was the goal to counter and fight commercial publishing massive profits while giving little service to the research community. Now, OA and OS tools and narrative have been appropiated by the same actors that were initially attacked by.


> ‚ÄúIf we travel back in time to the early days of open access, when it got its name and the movement first gained momentum, the type of open access that was staked out then was quite different from today‚Äôs. At the same time, the Budapest Open Access Initiativei introduced one of today‚Äôs most dominant themes, i.e. the need for acceleration: An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good. The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge. The new technology is the internet. The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds. Removing access barriers to this literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge. For various reasons, this kind of free and unrestricted online availability, which we will call open access, has so far been limited to small portions of the journal literature.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 3)

The Budapest OA Initiatie (2002)


> ‚ÄúIn this excerpt, the problem identified is the existence of an access barrier to the scholarly literature.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 3)

The Budapest OA initiative (and same as CS) identified paywalls as the main barrier of diffusion of knowledge.


> ‚ÄúIf we go one level higher, this access barrier creates a further problem that needs to be solved, namely that humanity is not united its ‚Äúquest for knowledge‚Äù nor in a ‚Äúcommon intellectual conversation‚Äù‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 3) 

We may be now in a position to ask whether the Budapest ambition to unite humanity (and in its wake, seemingly do away with world inequality through opening the gates of publishing costs) has come true. Not all research is open access, but significant steps have been made towards it. Have the OA model solved the problems of research in the global south. Are they better off?


> ‚ÄúSpecifically, the way science is seen to advance along an almost natural path by means of publishing results in papers and where more and more progress and development flows from science. Besides, they neglect that scientific publications in addition to their epistemic role where they are communicating content, also function as ways to indicate status, merit, advancement, belonging and so forth and are as such profoundly entangled across scholarly practices on many different levels.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 4)

The progress discourse of Open Access is based on the idea of articles as the main communication unit of science, however they do forget that they are also units of accountability (see [[2020-Fern√°ndez Carro]])


> ‚ÄúHowever, when in 2012 the so-called Finch group report was issued the difference was quite manifest. This ‚ÄúReport of the Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings‚Äù (5) is an extensive document commissioned by the British government. It details various processes involved in scholarly communication and the actors involved. One section is particularly relevant for understanding what the supposed problem is that open access is meant to solve.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 5)

The Finch report (2012) as a sign of institutions gaining interest on the initially researchers- and libraries-led OA initiatives.


> ‚Äúresearch‚Äôs insufficient transparency and accountability, the relative inefficiency and slowness of the research process, distance to innovation, insufficient returns on the investments made in research and hence inadequate contribution to public policy making and thus ‚Äì ultimately - to economic growth. The language alludes to the economism of new public management, where efficiency, transparency and most prominently accountability are staples (16).‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 5)

The Finch report on OA specifically frames transparency as a tool for accountability, to insure innovation as a means of economic growth. This is no different from what CS is advocating for.


> ‚ÄúCuriously the universities‚Äô own repositories are scarcely mentioned in the path towards open access that is sketched in the Finch Report. Open access is turned into gold open access and gold open access is equated with the commercial publishers‚Äô version of it ‚Äì pay to publish rather than for instance open access journals that are financed through grants, memberships, universities, or public funding as established for national journals in South America.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 6)

The Finch report already narrows OA as golden open access, instead of the already existing diamond open access.


> ‚ÄúOpen access, at least from the vantage point of policy makers and research funders, is now primarily a business model for managing relations between public funders and private enterprise, tied to the scientific community through performance indicators with the ultimate aim to increase efficiency, enable (commercial) innovation and economic growth. It is now also just a puzzle bit in a larger idea of open science, where the entire research process needs to be opened up according to very specific ideas about their previous closure.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 6)

OA becomes a business model, situating researchers as accountable to the taxpayer. This is a significant variation from the Budapest initiative, where statements about science's place were much more vague ("lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.")


> ‚ÄúConsidering that a considerable part of the transition once did begin with libraries and librarians, it is interesting that what counts here is not their experience with open access or even their role in scholarly communication, collection building and in preserving and making accessible the records of science, but their experience with publishers and budgets.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 6)

Reducing libraries role of OA as a budget manager (reducing to an economical role)


> ‚ÄúThroughout the text, and certainly in the speeches, the most eminent reasons for implementing open science and open innovation are framed in terms of competitions. Allusions are made to a race in science in which Europe is lagging behind or at risk of falling behind and which open science should help win. Acceleration, speeding-up, a theme that was already established in the Budapest open access Declaration, fifteen years earlier, is a defining feature of this vision for open science in Europe.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 7)

The framing of OS by institutions, like the EU has always been about boosting national and the EU standing in the world: it was framed as a matter of competition.


> ‚ÄúIn a figure in the report (3, p.15) open science is illustrated by various digital services from discovery, analysis, writing, publication, to outreach and assessment. The services and tools are presented in four rows, whereas three list services by Elsevier, Springer, and Google. The last row lists services by Wikimedia. Publishers and the biggest internet company of them all, Google, have here come to illustrate and signify open science. The roles of researchers are a lot less obvious. Theirs is a role that needs to change, adapt, transform, be surveilled, incentivized and most of all improved‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 8)

The role of the individual researcher in the OS movement: from the driver of change with agency and responsibility to the object that needs to change and the subject of surveillance


> ‚ÄúFor this, open access and open science are turned into performance indicators to be used for evaluating individual researchers.‚Äù (Haider, 2018, p. 8)
