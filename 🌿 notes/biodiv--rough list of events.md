## 1962, Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring*
A classic that is often mentioned as an example of the Cold War mindset of the environment: the effect of man-made technology (specially nuclear) in altering the environment.

## 1971, making of ICONA
Founding of ICONA by executive order (Decreto-Ley 17/1971). Merge of two institutions that were thereafter abolished:
- Patrimonio Forestal del Estado 
- Servicio de Pesca Continental, Caza y Parques Nacionales

## 1971, making of Comisión Interministerial para la Adecuación del Medio Ambiente (CIAMA)

## 1972, Ley 38/1972 de Protección del Ambiente Atmosférico (December 22, 1972)
See [Ley 38 1972 de Protección del Ambiente Atmosférico December 22 1972](relevant%20laws%20in%20Spain.md#Ley%2038%201972%20de%20Protección%20del%20Ambiente%20Atmosférico%20December%2022%201972) for details. 

## 1973, Endangered Species Act (ESA)
The legal "culmination" of biologists and concerned public pushing for the recognition of endangered species.

## 1973, collaborative development project between ICONA and US National Park Service
Training as a source of internationalisation of knowledge structures.

## 1974, Ley vía pecuaria (still need to look into the name)
Somewhat related to ICONA, as mentioned in [2021-López Lillo and López Santalla](2021-López%20Lillo%20and%20López%20Santalla.md), but unclear how.

## 1975, Ley de Espacios Naturales Protegidos
See [Ley de Espacios Naturales Protegidos May 2 1975](relevant%20laws%20in%20Spain.md#Ley%20de%20Espacios%20Naturales%20Protegidos%20May%202%201975) for details. 
The making of the category of 'Natural Park'. There was a reclasification of National Parks ([2001-Iniesta Gala](2001-Iniesta%20Gala.md)). This law passed in the context of the 'transición', and it gave a lot of power to the autonomous regions. 

While this law was in force, several new National Parks where declared:
- Garajonay

## 1980-1986, Royal Decrees about the administration and conservation of nature
Still unclear which ones, and how, but in this period, (several?) Royal Decrees where enacted that handled power of conserving nature to the individual regional autonomies. Briefly collected from [2017-Fernández Centeno et al](2017-Fernández%20Centeno%20et%20al.md). 

## 1986, National Forum on BioDiversity
Sometimes called the "first conference on biodiversity" ([[2016-Sepkoski]]).
21-24 September 1986, forum held in Washington, D.C., organised by Walter G. Rosen and E.O. Wilson, and sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Academy of Sciences ([1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), p. 35). See [A section on the history of the Washington conference on BioDiversity](1996-Takacs.md#A%20section%20on%20the%20history%20of%20the%20Washington%20conference%20on%20BioDiversity). Attended by about 14,000 people ([1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), 38).

According to [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md), Rosen coined the neologism 'biodiversity'. By Sarkar's account, this forum marked the beginning of the new interdisciplinary field "dedicated to the conservation of biological diversity", and also tied to the 1985 "manifesto" of the discipline by Soulé ([1985-Soulé](1985-Soulé.md)).

According to [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md), together with the [1973 Endangered Species Act ESA](#1973%20Endangered%20Species%20Act%20ESA), these two events were key in establishing the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md).

## 1987, World Commission on Environment and Development
Early calls for thinking of 'sustainable development'.

## 1988, Declaration of Belem
important moment for the interconection between biological and cultural diversity 

## 1989, Ley de Conservación de los Espacios Naturales y de la Flora y Fauna Silvestres
See [Ley 4 1989 de Conservación de los Espacios Naturales y de la Flora y Fauna Silvestres March 27 1989](relevant%20laws%20in%20Spain.md#Ley%204%201989%20de%20Conservación%20de%20los%20Espacios%20Naturales%20y%20de%20la%20Flora%20y%20Fauna%20Silvestres%20March%2027%201989) for details. 
A biodiversity, ecosystem framework for a new law. 

## 1992, United Nations "Earth Summit"
3-14 June 1992.

First UN-driven meeting on biological diversity. 
150 nations signed the UN 'Convention on Biological Diversity' which framed biodiversity as: **a good in itself** ("the intrinsic value of biological diversity", cited from [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md)) and in a **anthropogenic pragmatic** light ("that protecting biodiversity is in humanity’s own interest", cited from [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md)).

## 1995, Ley vía pecuaria (still need to look into the name)
Somewhat related to ICONA, as mentioned in [2021-López Lillo and López Santalla](2021-López%20Lillo%20and%20López%20Santalla.md), but unclear how.

## 1995, closing of ICONA
With the Royal Decree 1055/1995 (June 23), the Organismo Autónomo Parques Nacionales (OAPN), now dependent from the Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación, is formed by the merge and closing of ICONA and the Instituto Nacional de Reforma y Desarrollo Agrario (IRYDA).

## 1996, Conference "Endangered Languages, Endangered Knowledge, Endangered Environments"
Took place in Berkeley, sponsored by UNESCO, the World Wildlife Fund, and Terralingua. Later, paper appeared in volume *On Biocultural Diversity*.

'Biocultural diversity' first coined. 

## 1998, centralization of ICONA documentation
The Dirección General de Conservación de la Naturaleza starts to compile all institutional documentations about 'montes' from several organisms, some (like ICONA) already dissolved:
- Patrimonio Forestal del Estado
- Dirección General de Caza y Pesca Fluvial
- Distritos Forestales
- Instituto para la Conservación de la Naturaleza
- Own documents from the Dirección General de Conservación de la Naturaleza

See [2017-Fernández Centeno et al](2017-Fernández%20Centeno%20et%20al.md) for details on the documentation and archiving. 

## 2000, (more) compilation of ICONA documentation
While the making of OAPN dates from [1995](#1995%20closing%20of%20ICONA) and some documentation seems to have started in [1998](#1998%20centralization%20of%20ICONA%20documentation), the archiving and documentation of historical material from the ICONA and the IRYDA didn't properly start until a royal decree of 2000, by which the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente established that the Dirección General de Conservación de la Naturaleza had the task, among several, of keeping the [Fondo Documental del Monte ](🗄%20Instituto%20para%20la%20Conservación%20de%20la%20Naturaleza%20(ICONA).md#1%20Fondo%20Documental%20del%20Monte).

## 2001, UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity
2 November 2001.
UNESCO produces The Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, where cultural diversity is framed as a "resource".

## 2003, UNESCO booklet *Sharing a World of Difference: The Earth’s Linguistic, Cultural, and Biological Diversity*
One of the UN documents where biological and cultural diversity are explicitly linked. 

## 2007, Ley 42/2007 del Patrimonio Natural y de la Biodiversidad (Decmeber 13, 2007)
See [Ley 42 2007 del Patrimonio Natural y de la Biodiversidad December 13 2007](relevant%20laws%20in%20Spain.md#Ley%2042%202007%20del%20Patrimonio%20Natural%20y%20de%20la%20Biodiversidad%20December%2013%202007) for details.
