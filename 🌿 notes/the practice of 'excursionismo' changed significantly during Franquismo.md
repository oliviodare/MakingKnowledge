Together with [the unlinking of scientific efforts as the basis for nature management, which took place during the first years of the Francoist regime and which removed the characteristic feature of the early 20c conservation movement in Spain](during%20the%20early%20Franquism,%20nature%20conservation%20movements%20were%20unliked%20from%20the%20previous%20scientific%20efforts.md), the practice of 'excursionismo' as an leisure approach to nature changed. Before the Civil War and since the 19th century, 'excursionismo' was tightly linked to naturalist and scientific attitudes towards nature. After the war, it became tightly linked with youth associations with nationalist ideals and falangist groups. ([2006-Ramos Gorostiza](2006-Ramos%20Gorostiza.md), p. 108). However, this is not to say that Spanish naturalism was the same as in the other fascist european countries  at the time (Romania, Germany, Italy), where nature conservation had a much larger role in their regimes. ([2006-Ramos Gorostiza](2006-Ramos%20Gorostiza.md), 109).
