### Biodiversity, science
- [are all 'biodiversity' cases worthwhile studying?](are%20all%20'biodiversity'%20cases%20worthwhile%20studying?.md)
- [how does the temporal dimension mediate understandings of biodiversity?](how%20does%20the%20temporal%20dimension%20mediate%20understandings%20of%20biodiversity?.md)
- [where can conceptual ambiguity of 'biodiveristy' come from?](where%20can%20conceptual%20ambiguity%20of%20'biodiveristy'%20come%20from?.md)
- Has there been change with respect to abandoning a 'red list' approach to nature conservation and focusing more in 'biodiversity'? It seems as though the concept of biodiversity united a lot of scientists in the late 90s and early 2000s, so why are we still using 'red lists'? Or putting it differently, how do we put the 'biodiversity' framework ([1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md)) into action? Is 'ecosystem management', 'bioregionalism' (p. 71 in Takacs) one of those approaches? Is the problem that 'ecosystems' and 'habitats' are not well-defined entities (p. 72 in Takacs)?

### Synchronic, diachronic historical analysis - definition and differences?
According to [1989-Koselleck](1989-Koselleck.md), in the context of doing conceptual history:

> **Diachrony**: study of *language* (and in more general terms, of a specific analytical category) through time, thorough several of historical contexts. This is the history of structure, and the conditions that allow for speech. This is the main interest of social and conceptual history.
> **Synchrony**: study of *language*  (and as before, could refer here also of any specific analytic category) at a given historical point. This is the history of events, particulars, part of but not unique or main interest of social and conceptual history.
