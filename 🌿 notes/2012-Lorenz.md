## Highlights and notes


> “This essay analyzes how neoliberal ideology conceives of the public sector in general and, in particular, how this translates to an economic higher education sector.2 My first thesis is that neoliberal policies in the public sector— known as New Public Management (NPM)—are characterized by a combination of free market rhetoric and intensive managerial control practices. This combination explains the most important characteristics of NPM organizations. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 600)

Public sector is not just about the free market, but about high control of labour by management practices.

> “My second thesis is that NPM policies employ a discourse that parasitizes the everyday meanings of their concepts— efficiency, accountability, transparency, and (preferably excellent) quality—and simultaneously perverts all their original meanings. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 600)

Management modulates the meanings of conceps such as efficiency, accountability, transparency, and quality, which are concepts which are lauded by the open science community

> “This is tellingly illustrated by the present crisis in private financial markets in the US and Europe, which only keep on functioning through continual massive injections of public funds (in other words, taxpayers’ money) by the state.5 ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 601)

[academics' political pressure is relegated to asking for more money](academics'%20political%20pressure%20is%20relegated%20to%20asking%20for%20more%20money.md) Just as the financial crisis can only keep on functioning through massive injections of public funds, university researchers (since they are inserted in the same financial world), can only keep on functioning by demanding more money to the state.

> “In neoliberalism collective goods don’t exist, in contrast with classical liberalism. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 602)

> “The functioning of free markets assumes well-organized companies. Well-organized companies are in the interest of all shareholders because optimal management results in optimal efficiency and thus in optimal shareholder value. The management dogma makes the task of the state to remove all obstacles to efficient management. Because management equals efficiency in neoliberalism, it is Value for Money (VFM) by definition.9 NPM is VFM. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 602)

This is the relationship between management and or neoliberalism: it is in the interest of the shareholders (here the citizen is viewed as a shareholder) to have a well-organised institution because it improves accountability and efficiency.

> “The functioning of free markets assumes the presence of well-informed consumers who have sufficient purchasing power and can make rational, individual choices to buy goods and services based on their individual preferences” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 602)

[[academic funding is a choice of the citizen]] The OS movement, combined with the push for scientific communication, also feeds of these attitudes. The push for making the citizen more in touch with science is based on the idea that, given the free market as context we live in, individual citizen's have the power to understand science and the (economic) benefits it brings, and make rational choices as to support it.


> “Fundamentally NPM is the application of these four dogmas of the neoliberal economy to the domain of what used to be called the public sector. The public sector is redefined by NPM as a service sector that functions best when it operates in accordance with the principles of the free market. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 603)

[[Neoliberalism does not consist only in the privatization of public services, but also in the application of the cognition and practices of commercial practices into public services]] Neoliberalism is absorved.

> “The neoliberal denial of any other organizational principles than the market is something radically new because classical liberalism has emphasized the autonomy of the public sector (protected by law) from interference by the private sector. This was the essence of liberalism compared with feudalism.11 Market fundamentalism is therefore the very core of neoliberalism. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 603)

Very short history summary. Feudalism -> Liberalism (public sector strong protected from the private and the market laws) -> Neoliberalism (market laws apply everywhere)

> “In practice cost-efficiency in NPM discourse is usually interpreted as at least the self-financing of organizations, and if possible it is expected to make them profitable. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 605)

> “Because there are no substantial aims at all behind NPM policy, each cut in spending is simply a springboard to the next.22 Efficient, therefore, is never efficient enough. The distinction Max Weber makes between a substantial rationality based on values and a formal or instrumental endmeans rationality is simply rendered invisible by NPM discourse, which buries the notion of substantial effectiveness under that of formal efficiency” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 606)

Value in science would mean establishing a framework against which effectiveness (not efficiency) could be measured: is this system effective enough *for the objective we are aiming for?*

> “The same holds for the unstoppable rise of "accreditation agencies” that replace professional controls by handing out "stamp\[s\] of quality” to individual departments and that determine whether they "serve the demand of the market.”25 So here again NPM boils down to the notions that market rhetoric is good, and central control is better. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 607)

One of the objectives of the OS movement is the centralisation of quality not through peers but through "stamps of quality"

> “24. See Audit Cultures: Anthropological Studies in Accountability, Ethics, and the Academy, ed. Marilyn Strathern (London, 2000). For university rankings, see Rachelle L. Brooks, "Measuring University Quality,” Review of Higher Education 29 (Fall 2005): 1–21. For both audits and ranking, see Mu ̈nch, Akademischer Kapitalismus, pp. 94 –132, 155–236” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 607)

Literature on the notion of audits

> “What NPM comes down to in practice has been summarized by Mike Dent and Jim Barry into six processes: (1) increasing the breakup of public sector organizations into separately managed units, (2) increasing competition to use management techniques from the private sector, (3) increasing emphasis on discipline and sparing use of resources, (4) more hands-on management, (5) introduction of measurable indicators of performance, and (6) use of predetermined standards to measure output. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 608)

The process of NPM 1) separation into smaller units 2) increase competition 3) need for discipline 4) daily management 5) indications of performance 6) standarisation of measures

> “These processes manifest themselves in an increasing concentration in NPM on the supervision and regulation of the public sector through mechanisms such as audits and inspections.30 This emphasis on control brings to light the first hidden substantial aspect of NPM managerialism that is reminiscent of state Communism. Like Communism, NPM is totalitarian because it leaves no institutionalized room for criticism, which it always sees as subversion: ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 608)

Very citable.

> “The introduction of permanent control over faculty—which is unprecedented at least in the history of universities in democracies worthy of the name—is nothing other than the introduction of a culture of permanent mistrust. That is the second attribute that NPM shares with state Communism.” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 609)

3 aspects that NPM shares with communism are:
- CONTROL. management, audits, and inspections 
- DISTRUST. "culture of permanent distrust." In order to make sure that public investment is well spend, performance must be evaluated following centralised guidelines.
- CENTRALISATION: a unique framework of audit that leaves no room for external critizism. It aims to appear self-sufficient.

> “Managers who make higher education "efficient” and "transparent” by exercising constant control over the faculty are represented as the form that "accountability” to taxpayers and consumers takes in the former public domain. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 609)

Calls for 'efficiency' and 'transparency' hing on the idea of the citizen as a shareholder

> “That is the third attribute that NPM shares with state Communism. The question of whether managers really do spend taxpayers’ money more efficiently and whether they are more reliable than faculty cannot be asked in NPM. Nor may one ask whether the cost of the management controls are less than the money saved on inefficient academic personnel. The fact that there is not a shred of evidence for these two crucial assumptions of NPMrather the opposite—makes abundantly clear where the blind spots lie in NPM.34 T” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 609)

> “This brings us up against a fourth interesting similarity between neoliberal managerialism and state Communism: just as the Party by definition represents the interests of those who are led by the Party, so according to NPM management represents the interests of those who are managed. That is why NPM management models allow no place for representative bodies, which are only seen as a hindrance to administrative efficiency. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 610)

Open science and transaprency leaderboards are good for the people in the leaderboard.

> “NPM is an organizational discourse that promotes and legitimizes the takeover of power by managers in public organizations that were formerly run by professionals in accordance with their standards. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 610)

> “Performance-related pay replaces professionals’ intrinsic satisfaction with a system of externally driven rewards and at the same time allows management to divide-and-conquer. T” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 613)

> “On closer consideration, therefore, NPM itself turns out to be the problem in higher education, not the solution. This conclusion should come as no surprise because NPM is the neoliberal recipe for minimizing the public sector and maximizing the market sector without considering the fundamental differences between the public and private sectors or their complementary relationship. NPM in this respect bears a clear resemblance to state Communism. Whereas Communism stands for totalitarianism of the public sector, NPM stands for totalitarianism of the private sector. Both Communism and NPM are blind to the interdependence and complementarity of public and private domains, in both cases with disastrous consequences. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 614)

And this is the difference between neoliberalism and communism: unification and totalism of view.

> “The NPM Discourse: Efficiency, Quality, Accountability, Transparency, and Flexibility The NPM discourse is formed not only by its fundamental concept of efficiency but also by quality, transparency, accountability, and flexibility. All NPM notions parasitize their equivalents in the vernacular. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 617)

The main concept of NPM discourse is efficiency, but other concepts hing on it, and their meanings are modified by NPM's take on efficiency: 'quality', 'transparency', 'accountability', and 'flexibility'.

> “As stated earlier, NPM was propagated in the eighties as the means to make the public sector efficient and transparent and thus accountable. These ideas did not seem very controversial because the concept of accountability was a positive one borrowed from its everyday use, as Bruce Charlton explained. In the spoken language accountability means "being responsible,” with the connotation of giving an account of one’s actions. Its opposite unaccountable is more or less synonymous with "irresponsible” and "not being under control.” "Accountability is assumed to be an intrinsically desirable goal, and nobody ever claims that one can have ‘too much’ accountability—the pressure is always for more.”51 Alongside this everyday meaning, accountability also has a narrower, technical meaning: the duty to present verifiable accounts. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 617)

Accountability has two meanings: being responsible and being audited. NPM purposedly confuses the two, with an outer meaning used in everyday life as 'being responsible' yet what is in fact practiced is the financial quantification of work.

> “NPM discourse swings back and forth between the technical and vernacular meanings of accountability. When used in the technical sense it can generate "irresponsible” behavior because there are no accounts when there is no evidence at all that the behavior is irresponsible in the standard everyday meaning of the word. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 618)

The meanings are interchanged, and in its vagueness lies their discursive power. Evidence as well is important: accountability in the sense of being responsible, according to NPM, is achieved by (and only by) accountability in the sense of having numerical evidence, granted by increasing transparency.

> “From an organizational perspective, the call for greater accountability goes hand in hand with more power for management; in fact, under NPM all behavior is classed as irresponsible (and therefore unacceptable) if it is not controlled by management. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 618)

Irresponsible because it is not seen. Open Science follows this by sentences such as 'Open Science is just science done right' or promoting the idea that everyone has the same access to do OS.

> “This symptomatic fact also explains another consequence of the introduction of NPM in the academic world: the existence of widespread cynicism and hypocrisy among faculty regarding the application of QA procedures. Philip Tagg’s observations on this certainly do not apply only to England: Most colleagues find audit exercises ludicrous but nevertheless go through the motions of complying with their imperatives lest the wrath of management be incurred. We see straight through the emperor’s clothes, so to speak, but feel obliged to stifle our laughter and to hide our sense of ridicule when the emperor’s minions approach us "donkeys” with their managerial sticks and carrots. Repeated viewing of the emperor in his see-through clothing — transparency in the true sense of the word—leads to understandable cynicism towards the system that forces us to carry out the ridiculous chores of audit. A recurrent quip from colleagues is that we’re forced, like circus animals, "to jump through hoops.” The more circus tricks we perform, the more we demean ourselves. After all, the whole idea of forcing someone to carry out a pointless task is to demean that person.55 Shore makes the same point in observing that "auditing processes are having a corrosive effect on people’s sense of professionalism and autonomy.” Moreover, "dealing with the new performance measures has itself become a ‘performance’ in both the theatrical as well as sociological sense” ("AC,” pp. 292, 290). NPM thus cultivates cynicism and hypocrisy among its victims because "managing appearances will be a fruitful strategy if it is only appearances that get measured,” as Parker and Jary conclude ("MU,” p. 330).56 ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 620)

There is enough cynicism and memes out there. The academic baby boomers are growing grey hair and have learnt to make memes to spare their social dysfunction and their lack of political power. It's enough of cynisym and self-pity. Only by reclaiming value in science, and remove objectivity from the limelight, can we reclaim the social meaning of what it means to research.

> “As well as these two responses, the other alternatives are increasing self-exploitation, inner immigration, and—yes— dissidence. Once again there is a worrying similarity between management under state Communism and under NPM. Because both discourses leave no place for legitimate criticism, the response to what many of those affected see as bullshit are mixtures of cynicism, hypocrisy, self-exploitation, inner immigration, and dissidence. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 620)

Beyond self-pity, which lies at the core of a cynical and hypocritical community, who accepts to be exploited and exploits itself, we cannot allow brilliant minds and committed bodies to go on leaving academia with the tail behind their legs. We must construct a political awareness of our social group that goes beyond self-pity. Solutions: - narrow 'society' - build local resistance groups among which information is shared

> “This economic reduction of education is remarkable because education does not by any stretch of the imagination resemble the purchase of a product to satisfy a specific need. Participating in education is an ongoing, reciprocal, and hierarchical process, in which student and teacher are both actively involved and in which the teacher represents professional authority. The fact that education costs money—and so in this respect resembles the purchase of products such as Coca-Cola and cornflakes— does not mean that education is an economic transaction between a buyer and seller, as the economic view of education claims. That is why this view of education is fundamentally wrong and why it has so many perverse consequences. Because this view represents education as a free and equal exchange between equally positioned buyers and sellers, the hierarchical relationship between teachers and those being taught disappears, and this suggests that the purchasers of education have a right to get what they have paid for. To make matters worse, because the customer is always right in the market, students in the education market are also always right.58 ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 621)

Authority can be seen as an ally against an economic view. An authority based on knowledge and skills sets student and teacher at different levels; which pushes against the idea of buyer and seller. The economic vision of education (and research) undermines authority based on expertise.

> “The fundamental idea that a degree traditionally has cultural value only because and as long as it represents a specific level of knowledge and skills according to professional criteria is completely obscured in the economic view. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 622)

> “The Bullshit Nature of NPM Discourse Bringing all the arguments together, one is forced to conclude that the NPM discourse is Orwellian in nature because it redefines concepts such as quality, accountability, transparency, and professionalism and perverts them into their opposites. ” (Lorenz, 2012, p. 625)
