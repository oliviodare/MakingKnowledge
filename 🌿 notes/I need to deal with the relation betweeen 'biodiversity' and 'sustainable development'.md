# I need to deal with the relation betweeen 'biodiversity' and 'sustainable development'
#conceptnote #T-historiography 

The topic of 'sustainable development' is important and has a history too, and parallel to that of 'conservation' and 'biodiversity'. 

According to [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md):
> Around the time the term *biodiversity* made its appearance, another shibboleth, *sustainable development*, was also gaining clout. In graduate school, I earned an official minor in conservation and sustainable development. Contemplate this for a moment and you see another tension: how can we simultaneously conserve and develop? The growing needs of a growing population would seem to clash with the neeeds of those who want unsullied natural refugia. Thses forces classh in titanic battles over economic development, social justice, and long-term survival.<sup>1 [endnote referring to literature on the tension between 'development' and 'biodiversity']</sup> (p. 5)


A way of tackling this could be to address the relation between tension between conservation efforts and economic and industrial development, which, in the case of ICONA, leaned towards [making nature productive](ICONA%20had%20a%20variety%20of%20tasks%20in%20paper,%20but%20in%20practice%20they%20were%20centered%20around%20forest%20management%20and%20making%20nature%20productive.md), given the long history of the ingenieros de montes and [the context of autarky and producivitism of Franco's regime](ICONA's%20work%20was%20embedded%20in%20the%20autarkic%20and%20productivist%20political%20aims%20of%20Franquism.md).
