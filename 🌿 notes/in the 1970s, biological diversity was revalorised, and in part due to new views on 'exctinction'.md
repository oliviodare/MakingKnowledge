# in the 1970s, biological diversity was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'extinction'
#conceptnote #T-histenvir 

From the 19th century until the 1970s, 'extinction' were conceptualised through a Darwinian view ([the pre-1970s view on extinction was Darwinian](the%20pre-1970s%20view%20on%20extinction%20was%20Darwinian.md)), in which species would become extinc by means of a natural and *neutral* selection, in a slow and **inevitable** process. 

From the 1970s, a new view arose, and extinction came to be seen in a new light:
1.  sudden and catastrophic
2.  with permanent consequences for biodiversity
3.  not only targets the least fit (unpredictable)

The disciplines that contributed to this new lense on 'extinction' were:

-   **Paleontology**: evidence from the fossil record leading to the idea that mass extinctions did happen, which supported the idea that they _do_ and _can_ happen again.
-   **Cold War mentality**: nuclear threat to humanity leading to a culture of anxiety, uncertainty, and imminent risk.

This new views (scientific, political) contributed to the rise of the '[endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md)', which [reframed the meaning and value of biological diversity](the%20reification%20of%20biodiversity%20was%20the%20late-20c%20process%20of%20recognising%20natural%20variety%20as%20a%20tangigle,%20valuable,%20and%20manageable%20entity.md). 

See more about the larger cultural context in: [the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility](the%20second%20half%20of%20the%20twentieth%20century%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20collective%20environmental%20reflexivity%20and%20sensibility.md).

Major titles in ecology seem to support Sepkoski's thesis: Norman Myers's *The Sinking Ark: A New Look at the Problem of Disappearing Species* and Paul and Anne Ehrlich's *Extincition: The Causes and Consequences of the Dissappearance of Species*.

## A seeming contradiction.
While [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md) claims that the new concept of 'exctinction' influenced a new valorisation of 'biodiversity', it does appear to be the oppossite, as in the graphs that he shows, 'biodiversity' mentions have grown slowly since the 1950s, and 'mass exctinction' only sharply since the 1980s. This seems to (partially) contradict his argument.

## A nuance coming from Takacs
[1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md) would perhaps claim that the concept of biodiversity trancends some of the conceptual limits of framing environmental issues as a matter of extinction. He claims that framing of environmental issues on endangered species is a "narrow focus", and that the framing of biodiversity has a bigger "breadth [that] resolves (at least temporarily) a number of tricky problems." (p. 52)

As one of the evidence Takacs brings forward, he reports on the contemporary debates about the evidence supporting the idea that the rate of extinction has gone up. He also argues that by shifting to explain the environmental problem in the 'biodiversity' frame, "the switch to a strategy based on biodiversity can make species counts superfluous; instead, conservation comes to focus on pattern, process, and multiple hierarchical levels." (p. 53)

He also argues that the biodiversity approach does not rely on blurry definiton of what counts as 'species' (p. 53) and provides evidence of how *biodiversity* has a "bigger breath" than species-by-species conservation (p. 54-57), and how *given* uncertain knowledge, we can still argue for conservation.
