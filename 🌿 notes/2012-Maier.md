**Take-home message**:
Moral philosophy + science combo. This is a moral philosophy work, I only skimmed it, but it is not a discussion on what 'biodiversity' is or how value judgements come into its formation as a scientific and political concept. Rather, it seems to take biodiversity as "somewhat specialized out of the larger biological world" and attempts to find *the* flawless argument for why it's valuable. Not of my interest.

## Reading notes


> The currently overwhelmingly popular environmentalist view is that we must save biodiversity because biodiversity is too valuable to lose; and that our primary commitment to the natural world is expressed in this act of salvation.

The 'environmentalist' reason of why biodiversity is valuable.

> Disturbingly, these prevailing views have barely been examined or questioned.

I am curious about this - is that so? What had STS or historians of science/environment done until this point (e.g., critical studies on conservation science/ecology)?

> Instead of a solid edifice [in the arguments for the conservation of biodiversity], I found a chimera. I was stunned that I could not find a single argument that does not have serious logical flaws, crippling qualifications, or indefensible assumptions.” (Maier, 2012, p. 2)

> As I said, I feel strongly that it is important for people to behave well with respect to our natural environment. A lion’s share of the recent rationales marshaled on behalf of this view hinges on the value of biodiversity. However, these rationales are mostly so fragile that they crumble before modest scrutiny. Worse, those who have no true interest in the natural world can easily appropriate much of the reasoning for environmentally questionable and even destructive ends. In fact, this appropriation is already happening, it is accelerating, and it has the imprimatur of the most influential of biodiversity “advocates” and self-identified “conservationists”. The problem is that much of the same bad reasoning “for” biodiversity is easily conscripted in defense of the proposition that little in nature, including biodiversity, has much value. But perhaps most disconcerting of all is that the defective rationales, which purport to bolster the case for biodiversity’s value, infiltrate and misdirect the “conservation” project goals of the environmentalists and scientists who craft them. When this happens, the most capable would-be friends and protectors of the natural world inadvertently spend their precious time and resources accelerating its demise.


Is the claim that most people don't have good reasons for the cosnervation of nature or that don't value nature enough?  


Seems shallow.

> bad reasoning” (Maier, 2012, p. 3)

> But the principal purpose of this book is not to uncover the sociology or psychology behind these problems of reasoning. Rather, the book sets itself first the simpler task of uncovering the problems, and then the more formidable one of using this understanding as a springboard for another way of thinking about natural value.

This is a way of saying that he is not interested in the social and psycholgoical origins of the lack of consensus and the perceptions and ideas have (which we calls 'bad reasoning' or 'biases').

> Here, the thesis is: the signal value of the natural world is ensconced in biodiversity. Sometimes, the thesis is submitted as a kind of warning: that impingements on biodiversity will likely cause the collapse of nature or of the destruction of the planet as a human-inhabitable place. An intense effort to support some form of this thesis ensues. But after decades of effort, no argument can be found that “sticks”. This, I believe, is cause to reconsider the thesis. Maybe, just maybe, biodiversity is the wrong hook on which to hang the value of nature.


what does ensconced even mean  

Okey, main point seems to be that biodiversity is not a good scientific concept to draw value from, which I hardly doubt it. This discussion seems very different to what Santana does: understanding why biodiversity is not a good scientific value outright, to map and understand life.

> The book also challenges us to consider whether our actions and projects – which largely have flowed and right now are flowing **from faulty logic** – might consequently be unreasonable and undesirable. It is a truly sad thought that the greatest of all threats to nature might well come from the misjudged behavior of its would-be advocates.

Claims that conservation projects fail to truly value nature because "faulty logic": looks inside, dismisses the historical and sociological bases of why people behave and think about nature the way that they do.

> Unfortunately, that means that they display the same and often faulty reasoning. The logic and its defects are typically not changed by a slightly altered empirical premise or conclusion. The book has the goal of touching on all the most promising and credible arguments for biodiversity’s value

It seems he is looking for 'the' water-tight, faultless argument to defend nature, which seems naïve, and basing that in the best scientific and moral arguments. But would the universality/imperialism of that one such argument based on such narrow knowledge domains (philosophy and biology) be something that we would want?

> Many arguments are simply so flawed that their examination offers no illumination.

This categorisation of attitudes towards nature, first as "arguments" in defense of nature and the value of biodiversity is very reductive (why are all attitudes, images, etc about nature have to fit into his category of 'argument'), and why does he put them in the boxes of 'flawed', 'not flawed' (and things in between)?

> I conceive of my job as a moral philosopher to be one of fomenting change for the better. I do this by teasing out the logic in commonly offered lines of reasoning, posing challenging questions, and suggesting ways of thinking that are sufficiently discomfiting for people to feel that they need to reconsider their own lines of thought.

Is better reasoning the way to change the way we behave with the Earth? Lol. Why look so inwards, without looking at the historical, social, cultural contexts that make people reason in particular ways?

> I hope to sometimes provoke people to risk thinking things through on their own – perhaps for the first time – instead of accepting the word of even highly respected colleagues.

Pretentious.

> For my part, I have tried mightily to construct arguments that are sound in fact and logic. At the same time, I know that no attempt to address a topic this complex is without flaws; I will not be surprised if you discover some in this book. But I hope that one or two flaws in my reasoning will not dissuade you from the preponderant impression that the reasoning about biodiversity now before the general public, as well as in scientific, economic, and policy circles, is rife with flaws

LOL. HE THINKS THAT THERE ONE OR TWO FLAWS? It all just sounds very pretentious and thinks that the reasons for his flaws (which I just think it's because of his disciplinary narrowmindedness and trust on science/phil/academia) are that he is "address[ing] a topic this complex". FFS

> The days when the value of the natural world was found in the natural value of wilderness are over. And endangered species are just so 1970s. In the last two decades, those dated pegs for hanging environmental value have been largely supplanted by biodiversity.

BIODIVERSITY IS BASED ON THE ENDANGERMENT SENSIBILITY! ENOUGH UNHISTORICAL PHILOSOPHY FUUUK

> At the same time, as something of special value, I assume that biodiversity carves something somewhat specialized out of the larger biological world. At least, it is not equivalent the entire realm of the natural versus the realm of the supernatural. Nor even is it equivalent to (though it might be emblematic of) > all of nature” versus the human-constructed world.1 It requires a characterization that is narrow enough to avoid falling into those massive black holes.” (Maier, 2012, p. 71) Here we see that the the debate he is in is not the one of Santana et al.
