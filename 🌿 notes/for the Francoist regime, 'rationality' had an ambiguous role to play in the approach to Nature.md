# For the Francoist regime, 'rationality' had an ambiguous role to play in the approach to Nature
#conceptnote #T-histSpain

'Rationality' was seen as necessary for the adequate planning of how to exploit and conserve nature and as a matter of "controlling" the urge to exploit it. However, it wasn't seen as the all-powerful approach, as it had also limits: dealing with the complexity of and the interactions between nature and society made making predictions difficult. 

'Rationality' was embodied in two forms: *technological progress*, for example, one which would allow, as in the case of the [▵ Ley 38-1972](▵%20Ley%2038-1972.md), to "control, surveille, advice, and correct" atmospheric pollution; and *planning* (also from [▵ Ley 38-1972](▵%20Ley%2038-1972.md)), like a rational planification of economic growth and exploitation of the natural resources so as to permit development whilst preventing "irreversible ecological damange".

The picture of 'rationality' was that of control, both of ourselves and of Nature. There was a contrast between humans, responsible for overexploitation, and [Nature, which was seen as inherently self-generating and tending to equilibrium](for%20the%20Francoist%20regime,%20'Nature'%20was%20seen%20as%20self-sustaining%20and%20in%20equilibrium.md)
