# what is the legal framework of conservation in Spain and Europe?
## is there something like the USA's Endangered Species Act of 1973 at the national level in Spain or the international level in Europe?
#conceptnote #T-histSpain


For Spain: [relevant laws in Spain](relevant%20laws%20in%20Spain.md).

### what is the difference in focus as compared the the USA's 1973 ESA? 
The ESA is very strict and very focused on a species-by-species approach to nature preservation, see [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), p 64-69). Wonder whether since the Ley 42/2007 is more recent, it may have a much more 'biodiversity' sort of approach to conservation.

In the Spanish laws on the management of natural lands, we find a move towards the management of nature beyond the lense of fishing and hunting and more in tune with the conservation field and taxonomic practices.

### Complementary contemporary information and involved institutions
See more information about the role of the Spanish state in conserving biodiversity in the page of the 'Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico': '[Conservación de la biodiversidad en España](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/biodiversidad/temas/conservacion-de-la-biodiversidad/conservacion-de-la-biodiversidad-en-espana/default.aspx)', within one of the major themes of the Ministry, '[Biodiversidad y Bosques](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/biodiversidad/temas/default.aspx)'.


## Europe
Directiva de Hábitats, 1992
