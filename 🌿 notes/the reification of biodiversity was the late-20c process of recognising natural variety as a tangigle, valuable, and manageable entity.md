# the reification of biodiversity was the late-20c process of recognising natural variety as a tangigle, valuable, and manageable entity

This reification started in the mid twentieth century with figures such as [Aldo Leopold](1996-Takacs.md#Aldo%20Leopold%201887–1948) and his idea of nature as a pragmatic and emotional resource, [Charles S. Elton](1996-Takacs.md#Charles%20S%20Elton%201900–1992) and his treatment of "ecological variety" as (in the words of [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md)) a "concrete entity", and [Rachel Carson](1996-Takacs.md#Rachel%20Carson%201907–64), whose *Silent Spring* "popularized the trend among ecologists of reifying nature as a concrete entity" ([1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md), p. 27). Such reification, following Takacs, allowed not only for *one* kind of conceptualisation of nature, to be only defended or exploited, but allows for a variety of attitudes towards it: "Nature grew more tangible; it became a commodity that could be exchanged, valued, lost, gained, depleted, restored, quantified, scientized. This reification was essential if we were to hang a price tag, or a broader value tag, on nature." (p. 27). This process of reification, akin to the idea that [making lists is a precondition and one of the initial steps of practices of conservation](making%20lists%20is%20a%20precondition%20and%20one%20of%20the%20initial%20steps%20of%20practices%20of%20conservation.md), is a necessary historical process in the historical 'making of biodiversity'. "Once commodified as a thing apart," Takacs writes, "we can think about natural variety's wroth to us and talk about preserving it." (p. 27)
