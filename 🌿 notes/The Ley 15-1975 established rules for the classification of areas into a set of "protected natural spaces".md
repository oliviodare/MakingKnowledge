# The Ley 15/1975 established rules for the classification of areas into a set of "protected natural spaces"
#conceptnote #T-law 

[The Ley 15-1975 law stablished "legal regimes of protection" of specific areas, based on their "natural values"](The%20Ley%2015-1975%20law%20of%20'protected%20natural%20spaces'%20aims%20at%20creating%20"legal%20regimes%20of%20protection"%20of%20specific%20areas,%20based%20on%20their%20"natural%20values.".md), and depending on their value, it established a system of classification:

## Integral reserves of scientific interest (*Reservas integrales de interés científico*)
These are relatively small areas with "exceptional scientific value".

## National Parks (*Parques Nacionales*)
These are defined as large natural spaces which still contain within them "original ecosystems that have not been sustantially altered by the penetration, exploitation and occupation by humans, and where the plant and animal species, as well as the places and geomorphic formations convery distinguished cultural, educational, recreational interest or where there exists natural landscapes of large beauty."  

Of course this definition is relatively broad, but as well, by its emphasis on originality and hardly access, it provokes in the reader's mind the landscape of a mountain. 

For this class (as well as for the other), the State will set the rules by which it will be allowed an "orderly use, enjoyment, contemplation, and exploitation of the Park's productions". Here again we see the [hope for rationality](for%20the%20Francoist%20regime,%20'rationality'%20had%20an%20ambiguous%20role%20to%20play%20in%20the%20approach%20to%20Nature.md) to avoid overexploitation.

## Natural Landscapes of National Interest (*Parajes Naturales de Interés Nacional*)
 These are larger, but "particularised" spaces or elements which are styll worthy of attention, perhaps for having "concrete and singular values". A lot of attention to uniqueness here. For these class, use and exploitation is much more lax as compared to national parks.

 
## Natural parks 
Those that have "qualified natural values" and they are meant for "mankind" to get in touch with nature. Here livestock raising is allowed.
