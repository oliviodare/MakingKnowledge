# The new historiography of spanish agricultural history questions the concept of 'backwardness' and contributes to descriptions of how that concept came about
#conceptnote #T-histSpain


The historical characterization of Spain as being technologically 'backward' is itself product of the historical time where the notions of 'modernity' and 'backwardness'  were being contested. Historical actors, specifically engineers, promoted and used such notions and their associated concepts in their quest to push for reforms in several fields, like agricultural engineering and the Francoist regime promotion of technologies such as pesticides ([2019-Bertomeu-Sánchez](2019-Bertomeu-Sánchez.md)), hidraulic projects ([[2018-Gil Farrero]]).
