## Reading notes

### Sabina Leonelli, 'Reframing Biodiversity from the Data Up: Challenges from Plant Data Semantics'
Not only is taxonomy the only discipline about how to deal with species naming

many others 'expert systems'

grand challenges to establish a global standard naming procedure of crop traits and varieties, given the local and sytem-specific knowledge practices.

cassava ontology database (cassavabase), going on for over 10 years.

cassavabase includes ontologies that are not important for taxonomists but are for e.g., breeders, or food procesing. 

data-driven: not really what's really happening
data-intensive: decision making is everywhere, at the production, collection, and management of data and data-infraestructure

### Helen Curry, 'Local Seeds and Global Needs: Ethnobotany, Agroecology, and the History of in situ Conservation in agriculture'  
Main claim: what matters to undersand the history of genetic diversity conservation is not changing views of plants, but rather how people view people, specifically how scientists's views on farmers -> 

in-situ conservation
