[the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility](the%20second%20half%20of%20the%20twentieth%20century%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20collective%20environmental%20reflexivity%20and%20sensibility.md). More concretely, [in the 1970s, biological diversity was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'exctinction'](in%20the%201970s,%20biological%20diversity%20was%20revalorised,%20and%20in%20part%20due%20to%20new%20views%20on%20'exctinction'.md). 

The revalorisation of the concept of 'biodiversity' was tight together with new views on exctinction. Together with the paleontological evidence, there were several reasons by which, from the mid-20c 'biodiversity' became a normative concept ([diversity isn't a descriptive term, but a "supreme late-modern value"](diversity%20isn't%20a%20descriptive%20term,%20but%20a%20"supreme%20late-modern%20value".md)) and a "vital resource" for mankind:
  - ecologists emphasized more the **fragile interconnectedness** of ecosystems, and the importance of all taxa in having an reaching an stable habitat.  
  - move towards **utilitarian** arguments in conservation and environmentalism.  
  - the **degradation** of the natural environment **sped up**, linked to a demographic expansion of Western societies. The consequences of antrhopogenic effects on the environment became clearer.  
  - the arguments supporting environmental care focused more on **unforeseen consequences** (there may be a link towards risk and late modernity here)  
   - despite the unforeseen consequences, biologists started to develop tools and aquire data to be able to **predict these consequences**.



Charles S. Elton was one of those who, already in the 1950s, conceptualised 'diversity' in the new light:
> Elton's final chapter [in _The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants_], "The Conservation of Variety", reveals his ecologist's slant on the world. He is not concerned with individual species, so much the fouc of conservation efforts then and later. Rather, he is interest in a forerunner of biodiversity, "ecological variety", which he treats as a concrete entity requiring our concern and protection. What counts is the dynamics of the ecological community, the innumerable complex interactions that keep systems stable. The ideal state of nature is diverse wilderness, epitomized by the tropic rain forest. (p.24, [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md))
