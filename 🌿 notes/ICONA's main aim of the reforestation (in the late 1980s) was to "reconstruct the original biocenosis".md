Despite the [economic viability priority of reforestation and the evaluation of their ecological impact](ecological%20assessments%20in%20ICONA%20were%20done%20according%20to%20"their%20own%20judgment"%20and%20economic%20viability%20was%20a%20priority.md), ICONA also recognised, [at least in 1989](▵%20Circular%20nº1-1989.%20Estimación%20de%20posibles%20impactos%20ambientales%20de%20las%20restauraciones%20de%20la%20cubierta%20vegetal.md), that the objective of the reforestations was to "reconstruct the [[original biocenosis]]." They claimed that they wanted to have a "diversified reintroduction of a group of species" and that monospecies reforestation was not their aim.
