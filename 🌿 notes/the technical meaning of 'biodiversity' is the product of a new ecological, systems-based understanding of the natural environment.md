This is a claim from [2016-Sepkoski](2016-Sepkoski.md), who claims that "this new technical understanding of diversity [as the complex interactions and interdependence between taxa and physical environments] was in part a product of a new understanding of extinction [as a catastrophic and sudden phenomena]; that it was highly influential on the establishment of the biodiversity movement."
