- episodes: concrete

It's an iterative process between concrete and abstract, not between top-down or bottom-up.

Empirical netwok analysis (ENA) to assist the process of Chang


What is ENA?
- Broad set of theoretical, computation, and statistical tools.
- Used to represent entities and boserved relations between them to systematically study the properties of both.

ENA kind of data:
- empirical data such as bibliometric data

ENA methods:
- computation methods

ENA in a case study:

Question: how scientific innovations are diffused accross scientific domains?

- Scientific innovation: Kuhn's esential tension between novelty of an innovation and the need for align with existing tradition
