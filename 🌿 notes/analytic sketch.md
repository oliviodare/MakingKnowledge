# An analytic sketch of my [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md) framework

1. <u>**WHAT IS BEING LOST?**</u> as a historically-situated question, and instance of the rise in the [endangerment sensibility](endangerment%20sensibility.md) of the second half of the twentieth century.
3. <u>**WHAT SHOULD WE TARGET TO SAVE IT?**</u> as the questions that operationalised 
4. <u>**HOW DO WE TRACK IT?**</u> as the epistemic question necessary to answer **(1)** in concrete terms. This could also be called 'how do we know about what are we losing?'. Here we include debates into the measures, indicators, and proxies of biodiversity, like [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md)'s discussion of biodiversity surrogates. Here, (on of) my question(s) would be something like [what role does gathering, collecting, curating, and displaying data play when identifying what is being lost and what its worth?](what%20role%20does%20gathering,%20collecting,%20curating,%20and%20displaying%20data%20play%20when%20identifying%20what%20is%20being%20lost%20and%20what%20its%20worth?.md)
5. <u>**HOW DO WE KNOW HOW TO INTERVENTE?**</u> as the epistemic question necessary to answer **(2)** in concrete terms. This question is a question about how to put into action the knowledge and data generated in **(3)** (given the knowledge about what's being lost, what is the best approach to conserving it?) and so it's also about who has the relevant knowledge to intervene.

The relation between **(1)** and **(2)** is about operationalisation of knowledge.
The relation between **(3)** and **(1)** is about epistemology.
The relation between **(4)** and **(2)** is about epistemology.
The relation between **(3)** and **(4)** is *complicated*: seems to be epistemic (how useful, applicable, reliable is the knowledge of tracking what's being lost to our interventions to save it) and about values (how do our values about what we care relate to our approaches to keeping it?). 

This is a sketch for [synchornic](🌳%20biodiv--questions%20arising%20☝🏻.md#Synchronic%20diachronic%20historical%20analysis%20-%20definition%20and%20differences)  analysis --> it may be relevant for comparative analysis, but I may need to consider:


- how does it change in time?
- is there a more relevant or useful sketch for diachronic analyses?
