Las CEE (Comunidades Económicas Europeas) establecieron diferentes legilaciones: 
 1.  "Ley fundamental": Directiva núm. 64/404/CEE du Conseil, de 14 de junio de 1966. 
 2.  Modificaciones: directivas núm. 69/64/CEE y núm. 75/445/CEE.
 3.  Normativa recogida en la Política Forestal Comunitaria elaborado de 1979.


The idea is that each country would start adopting these norms progressively and to their own rhythm, but eventually would make it mandatory.


Estas normativas legislavan a varios niveles:
1.  It says that it's important to use seeds of **high genetic quality** for reforetation or to make new forests, and to **keep track of the origin** of the seeds used
2.  **several species** (15) are regulated, including *Pinus nigra Arn.*, *Pinus sylvestris L.*, and *Pinus strobus L.* (among others) which are the main trees in Central Europe
3.  It then follows **norms about several technical features** in the production of seed, like the age of the trees, the production volume, the collection of seeds... It also determines the norms about how to go about with the progeny tests, and their evaluation
4.  Finally, it gives n**orms for the commercialisation of the materials**, like making mandatory that every country should have a **list of admited species**, and a series of datapoints that need to be specified: especies, varity, cateogy, origin region, base materials for controlled reproduction, etc.
5.  It also specifies the **conditions and phenotypes that the seeds and the plants must meet**, for instance, the maximum content of material from other species, the size of the seed, the defects of the plants that aren't allowed, etc
