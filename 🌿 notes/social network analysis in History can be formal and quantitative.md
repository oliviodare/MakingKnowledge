# social network analysis in History can be formal and quantitative
#conceptnote #T-historiography 

Together with the idea that [social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md), SNA can also be used to give a formal and quantitative relation. I yet have to investigate the method, but Renn direct us to some case studies:

- Preiser-Kapeller (2015), 'Harbours and Maritime Networks as Complex Adaptive Systems' in *Harbourgs and Maritine Netowrks as Complex Adaptive Systems: A Thematic Introduction*.
- Laubichler, Maienschein, and Renn (2013), 'Computational Perspectives in the History of Science: To the Memory of Peter Damerow', *Isis*.
- Lemercier (2015), 'Formal Network Methods in History: Why and How?' in *Social Networks, Political Institutinos, and Rural Societies*
- DÃ¼ring (2017), 'Historical Network Research: Network Analysis in the Historical Disciplines'. https://historicalnetworkresearch.org
