# Questions arising

## Biology

### What are cladistic analyses?

### What are sister taxa?

### What other concepts is ‘biodiversity’ associated with?

### What fields used it first and in which scientific and political contexts? (Paleontology, Conservation Biology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology)

### How is and was biodiversity measured, and depending on each field?

### What is (global) stratigraphy?

### What is the “pull of the Recent”?

## History

### Synchronic, diachronic historical analysis?
According to [1989-Koselleck](1989-Koselleck.md), in the context of doing conceptual history:

> **Diachrony**: study of *language* (and in more general terms, of a specific analytical category) through time, thorough several of historical contexts. This is the history of structure, and the conditions that allow for speech. This is the main interest of social and conceptual history.
> **Synchrony**: study of *language*  (and as before, could refer here also of any specific analytic category) at a given historical point. This is the history of events, particulars, part of but not unique or main interest of social and conceptual history.
