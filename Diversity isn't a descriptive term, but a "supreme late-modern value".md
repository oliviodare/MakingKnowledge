# 'Diversity' isn't a descriptive term, but a "supreme late-modern value"
#conceptnote

What I understand by the relation of 'diversity' to #latemodernity is that the meaning of 'diversity' is embedded by a notion of *culture* as not only separate, but something that actively endagers the state of *nature*. In a late-modern framework, two processes endanger such diversities: industrialisation and increased fluidity, by drawing from an homogenising force. 

From [2017-Vidal and Dias](2017-Vidal%20and%20Dias.md), I am feel inclined to say that "diversity" is good by virtue of being at risk, therefore it takes a dynamic definition, one that embodies two specific movements: 
- one of modernity threatening its own existence by destroying the environment modern humans inhabit; and
- another movement of late modern knowledge practices as being able to assess then risk and pose solutions to the loss of diversity.
