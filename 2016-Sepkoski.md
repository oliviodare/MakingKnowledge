> Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973

[1973 Endangered Species ACT ESA](🗓️%20biodiv--a%20rough%20list%20of%20events.md#1973%20Endangered%20Species%20ACT%20ESA). The legal "culmination" of biologists and concerned public pushing for the recognition of endangered species.

> meeting in Washington, DC of the National Forum on BioDiversity,

1986 National Forum on BioDiversity, organised by Walter Rosen and E.O. Wilson, that draw attention to the "biodiversity crisis"

> Together, these two events are central to the establishment of what this volume is describing as the “endangerment sensibility,” which may be defined as “a network of concepts, values and practices dealing with objects considered threatened by extinction and evanescence, and with the techniques aimed at preserving them” that has come to have a central place in contemporary scientific, cultural, and political discourse (Vidal and Dias this volume).

The 1973 ESA act and the 1986 BioDiversity meeting are seen as central events in the making of the "endangerment sensibility"

> Both the endangerment sensibility and the broader discourse of diversity share a fairly recent historical emergence that can be located, quite precisely, in the late 1970s to mid-1980s. It is at that time that a new set of public and political discourses focusing on a wide array of endangered entities – species, ecosystems, languages, artifacts, and cultures – were initiated, along with the development of


> the sense that diversity itself is a value to be protected and celebrated in Western societies. But why did these discourses appear at this precise historical moment?


> I argue that a central causal factor was the development of a new biological understanding of the phenomenon of extinction, which both recast the nature of the threat of endangerment to biological entities, and also underlay a revaluing of the biological concept of diversity. This shift in biological understanding profoundly influenced the wider social, political, and cultural awareness of extinction and diversity that has shaped the endangerment sensibility of the early 21st century.

The 1970s and 1980s were important in the development of the endangerment sensibility because diversity and extinction were recast as through a biological understanding, and this new lense shaped our endagerment sensibility until today. [the second half of the twentieth century was unique in a rise in the collective environmental reflexivity and sensibility](the%20second%20half%20of%20the%20twentieth%20century%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20rise%20in%20the%20collective%20environmental%20reflexivity%20and%20sensibility.md).

> Broadly speaking, this history reveals a transition from a scientific belief that extinction was a slow, gradual, and inevitable process driven by natural competition between individuals that was the direct consequence of natural selection (a “Darwinian view”), to one in which extinctions were understood to be sometimes catastrophic, geologically sudden events that could extinguish multiple taxonomic groups in a single blow, and in which the Darwinian logic of natural selection was not always predictive of survival.

New understanding of exctintion: from gradual to sudden

> An additional argument of this chapter is that biological concepts of extinction and diversity are linked,” (Sepkoski, 2016, p. 63)

> The central components of the extinction discourse that prevailed during the era of Darwin and beyond were that extinction 1) is slow and gradual; 2) is reciprocally balanced by the replenishment of new species (nature’s economy); and 3) is in some sense progressive – that is, by reflecting the “fair” outcome of natural competition, it contributes to the robustness of living ecosystems by weeding out “unfit” individuals or species.

The Darwin and pre-1970s 'biodiversity crisis view'. [[the pre-1970s view on extinction was Darwinian]]
  
Extinction as:  
1) slow and gradual  
2) balanced with the birth of new species  
3) progressive (death as a productive life force)

> by the 1970s, a radically new extinction discourse emerged that held that extinction 1) can be sudden and catastrophic; 2) can have permanent ecological and evolutionary consequences for diversity; and 3) is in some cases agnostic toward selectivity – in other words, extinctions do not necessarily target the “weakest” or least “fit” organisms and species.

The new view of extinction:  
  
1) sudden and catastrophic  
2) permanent consequences for biodiversity  
3) not only targets the least fit

> Because of the Malthusian principle of limited resources and fierce competition, natural selection is essentially a zero-sum game where the number of winners will always be balanced by an equal number of losers. Far from being mysterious or anathema, extinction is an essential process for keeping nature in a healthy balance.

[nineteenth-c views on 'extinction' were characterised by a strong idea of the 'balance of nature', which conceptualised it as a fair, inevitable, and gradual phenomena](nineteenth-c%20views%20on%20'extinction'%20were%20characterised%20by%20a%20strong%20idea%20of%20the%20'balance%20of%20nature',%20which%20conceptualised%20it%20as%20a%20fair,%20inevitable,%20and%20gradual%20phenomena.md). Players and thoughts in the 19c:  
    
1. General theological understanding of plenitude, with the idea that God wouldn't create something inperfect or in vain.  
  
2. Georges Cuvier: the expection to the rule. Introduced the idea of "revolutions" and catastrohic mass extinctions. What was upsetting to mast naturalist was not that God *could* be removed from the explanation, but that it negated the idea of 'balance of nature'  
  
3. Charles Lyell: philosophy of uniformitarianism. While not believing in evolution, he proposed a theory of geology where the Earth changes slowly and makes species adapt. Those that don't, get extinct but others would arise. The one-to-one relation between geology and biology, made it possible to think of biological extinction to follow the slow mechanisms of geological changes.   
  
3. Darwin. In comparison to Cuvier, he instead didn't reject the idea of 'balance of nature' in his theory of evolution. He took from Lyell's view and made natural selection (a slow process) to be the driving force of extinction. Within the Darwinian framework, natural selection (and by extension, extinction) was a zero-sum game.

> for the most part, the received view was that extinction was gradual, inevitable, and “fair.”

> The message, to put it bluntly, was that if extinction is inevitable and even beneficial, why should society care if it happens? Both Lyell and Darwin explicitly discussed the extinction of human races as a natural phenomenon, which they and other authors reasoned at least implicitly to mitigate the responsibility of Europeans for the negative consequences of colonial expansion. In *Principles*, Lyell wrote, for example, about the inevitability of widespread (non-human) extinction in the wake of colonialism: “We must at once be convinced, that the annihilation of species has already been effected, and will continue to go on hereafter, in certain regions, in a still more rapid ratio, as the colonies of highly-civilized nations spread themselves over unoccupied lands”

The idea of a neutral, or even beneficial, slow and inevitable idea of extinction allowed to see it as justifiable. There was no need to counteract extinction, and outcomes such as the extinction of cultures were seen as neutral.

> As Brantlinger puts it, this extinction discourse was “a powerful nexus of ideas that has been hegemonic for countless European explorers, colonists, writers, artists, officials, missionaries, humanitarians, and anthropologists (Brantlinger 2003, 190). Whether or not it was seen as desirable, cultural and racial extinction was, almost universally, regarded as inevitable.

Extinction as:
- Natural  
- Inevitable

> Darwin and Lyell were hardly alone among Victorian men of science in holding this view, nor did Darwin’s theory of evolution via natural selection produce it out of nowhere. Darwin first entertained these ideas while aboard the HMS Beagle during the early 1830s (and well before his evolutionary ideas were fully developed), remarking in his account of that voyage that “wherever the European has trod, death seems to pursue the aboriginal,” and observing that “the varieties of man seem to act on each other in the same way as different species of animals – the stronger always extirpating the weaker.

Darwin was not the first one to think of extinction as natural and inevitable.

> Darwin’s theory of natural selection, then, certainly did not create this extinction discourse, but it apparently made the “preordained law” responsible for inevitable extinction seem considerably less mysterious. In an 1864 essay titled “The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of Natural Selection,” Darwin’s close friend and supporter Alfred Russell Wallace used natural selection to essentially justify European imperial expansion.

Darwin's theory did help in justifying colonialism.

> The crux of the matter is that, in Victorian society and beyond, extinction was considered both an inevitable and a progressive process, whether applied to humans or to “lower” organisms. This view came from biology, but it is inseparable from a broader set of cultural and political attitudes about race and social progress. It certainly did not promote the active protection of threatened peoples or organisms, nor did it celebrate intrinsic biological or cultural difference. “Diversity” was not an independent value at this time in biology or culture because it had not been identified as something necessary for biological or cultural stability.

Perhaps we could even say that 'extinction' was that independent value that was necessary for the stability of life.

> In fact, if anything, extinction was a positive good: by removing the unfit, it acted for the betterment of species or “races.”

> The development I want to focus on here – which has received scant attention in the history of conservation biology – is the emergence of a new set of ideas about extinction that were put forward during the 1970s and 1980s.

He does a history of the idea of biodiversity and the biodiversity movement by focusing on the concept of 'extinction'.

> These ideas, which emerged primarily from paleontology and effectively rehabilitated the notion of catastrophic mass extinctions, were a crucial ingredient in a new appreciation of the threat posed by extinction and a new positive valuing of biological diversity that are combined in the biodiversity movement. This “new catastrophism” was explicitly grounded in better empirical understanding of the patterns of mass extinction in the fossil record, but it also undoubtedly was both influenced by and contributed to a broader culture of anxiety that prevailed during the Cold War era, centered around perceived threats of nuclear Armageddon, political uncertainty, and environmental disaster (Badash 2009; Hamblin 2013).

The new lenses to understand extinction: new catastrophism and mass extinction. The sources of this new lense:  
- **Paleontology**: evidence from the fossil record leading to the idea that mass extinctions did happen, which supported the idea that they _do_ and _can_ happen again.
- **Cold War mentality**: nuclear threat to humanity leading to a culture of anxiety, uncertainty, and imminent risk.

> It is worth noting that the word “diversity” has a slightly different meaning as a colloquial term than in its precise scientific definition. Some authors tend to conflate the two meanings, or miss the very specific way in which biologists and ecologists now employ the term. For example, in some definitions, biological diversity is misunderstood as being essentially reducible to taxonomy: one observer has commented for example that biological diversity, “both as a vernacular and a scientific concept, is about the classification of perceptible things and phenomena, especially species” (Oksanen 2004, 2). The biological study of diversity may indeed rely heavily on classification, and it is fair to say that what was understood as “diversity” up through Darwin’s day might fit the above description.4 But, as paleontologist Peter Ward points out, “diversity is also a highly technical term with a rigid mathematical definition; it encompasses not only the number of species, but also the relative abundance of the various coexisting species” (Ward 2000, 27). In other words, when biologists now talk about diversity, they do not simply refer to the total number of taxonomic entities that exist at a particular time and place, but also invoke a fairly complex understanding of the relationships and interdependence of these taxa with one another and with their physical environments. **I am arguing that this new technical understanding of diversity was in part a product of a new understanding of extinction; that it was highly influential on the establishment of the biodiversity movement**; and that, consciously or unconsciously, formulations of cultural diversity now often invoke this more complex “ecological” sense.

This is interesting, he claims that the understanding of biodiversity by scientists in highly technical terms (with the academic debates on what 'biodiversity' means, how can we measure it, how should we govern it) is a product of the new conception of **extinction**. [the technical meaning of 'biodiversity' is the product of a new ecological, systems-based understanding of the natural environment](the%20technical%20meaning%20of%20'biodiversity'%20is%20the%20product%20of%20a%20new%20ecological,%20systems-based%20understanding%20of%20the%20natural%20environment.md)


> This rise tracks very closely to a Google n-gram graph of the appearance of the term in the text of books during the 20th century; it also – not coincidentally, I argue – tracks the pattern of an n-gram for the term “mass extinction” (Figure 2.1).

There is a rise from the 1960, and specially from 1970s in the study of 'diversity' in biology journals, paralleling a similar rise in the study of 'extinction'. However, while he claims that the new concept of 'exctinction' influenced a new valorisation of 'biodiversity', it does appear to be the oppossite, as in the graphs that he shows, 'biodiversity' mentions have grown slowly since the 1950s, and 'mass exctinction' only sharply since the 1980s. This seems to (partially) contradict his argument that [in the 1970s, 'biodiversity' was revalorised, and in part due to new views on 'exctinction'](in%20the%201970s,%20'biodiversity'%20was%20revalorised,%20and%20in%20part%20due%20to%20new%20views%20on%20'exctinction'.md).

> What the fossil record did show was a complex pattern of steep rises and sharp plummets in levels of diversity over the history of life. Beginning in the 1970s, paleontologists began serious efforts to inventory the entire marine fossil record, essentially by counting the number of fossil taxa (genera and families, primarily) that had ever been discovered, and analyzing the resulting data (Sepkoski 2012). What this analysis showed was that there is a general trend toward increasing diversification, beginning during the Cambrian explosion 500 million years ago and continuing to the present.


> In other words, while diversity appears to tend toward equilibrium for lengthy periods of time, diversity has not been stable over the entire history of life, and in general, the pattern is one of increasing diversity (number of taxa) over time (Sepkoski et al. 1981).


> In 1984, Raup and Sepkoski published a paper arguing that there have been five such extinction events over the past 500 million years and, remarkably, that these extinctions (along with more minor though still “mass” extinctions) appear to follow a regular periodicity, occurring roughly every 26 million years (Raup and Sepkoski 1984). The major evolutionary interpretation they advanced was that these events could not be explained as the product of natural selection alone; they were catastrophic episodes that effectively “reshuffled the deck” for evolution, wiping out formerly long-standing taxa (like the dinosaurs) and ushering new ones to evolutionary prominence (such as the mammals). If the significance of these mass extinctions was to be credited, this presented an entirely new view of extinction: while normal or “background” extinctions probably occurred slowly and constantly, as Darwin had held, a significant mechanism in the history of life and of diversification were events that appeared to follow no Darwinian rules of selectivity, in which entire taxa disappeared through no “fault” of their own.

New evidence uncovers a new concept of the mechanisms of extinction:  
- appear periodically in history  
- fast events, not gradual  
- can wipe off entire taxa  
- there is no given selectivity, natural selection is not the mechanism behind (all kinds of) extinction.

> The Raup-Sepkoski extinction work happened to coincide with another major event in paleontology: the discovery, by a team led by geologist Walter Alvarez, of circumstantial evidence that a massive meteorite impact had occurred 65 million years ago, at the exact moment when the dinosaurs disappeared from the fossil record. This, potentially, was the kind of non-selective trigger implied by the Raup-Sepkoski work, and together these findings created a sensation in the scientific community and the popular media. Major magazines and newspapers, from Time a n d Newsweek to the New York Times and the Washington Post, gave the new impact-extinction theories front page billing, and many paleontologists were thrust into the international spotlight.

New evidence brings forward another (hypothetical) mechanism for catastrophic extinction: meteorites.  
  
Media echos these two new ways of thinking about extinction.

> If the dinosaurs could go, the idea went, then so could we humans

Summary of the new Cold War mentality.

> extinction was essentially redefined in terms of diversity: mass extinctions are recognized in the fossil record, explicitly, as those periods when diversity drops significantly in a short amount of time.

Main consequence of the paleontological-driven new concept for extinction: extinction defined in terms of biodiversity.

> While Raup and others acknowledge that background extinction tends to follow selective logic, episodes of mass extinction introduce a new set of rules. It is not exactly the case that selection plays no role in mass extinction: when evolutionary/environmental catastrophes occur – such as an asteroid impact – a certain number of species will undoubtedly be killed immediately. For those organisms, extinction has been purely “bad luck.” But even in the aftermath, when selection begins again, the rules that formerly governed adaptive success may have been completely upended, to the extent that previously dominant species will suddenly find themselves poorly adapted for their new circumstances.

Reframing of the role of natural selection as a mechanism in exctinction.

> This can have a narrowing effect on diversity over time: if life reached a point of maximal difference (or “disparity,” meaning major genetic and morphological dissimilarity between higher taxa) early on during the Cambrian explosion, and if each subsequent extinction event has stochastically removed some number of those disparate higher taxa (orders or phyla), then evolution has less and less genetic and morphological difference to “work with” as time goes on. This means that even if diversity – as measured by the sheer number of species alive – has increased, it has become a more homogeneous kind of diversity, since those species are clustered within fewer and fewer higher taxa. This was the argument that Gould famously made in his book Wonderful Life, and it was both inspired and confirmed by the work of his fellow paleontologists on extinction (Gould 1989)

Changing the kind of diversity (from coarse to fine) in the history of life.

> It was at the height of the scientific and public interest in mass extinctions that, in 1986, the biodiversity movement formally began. There were certainly earlier contributing factors – a long history of conservation efforts focused on preserving individual endangered species, for example (Barrow 2009; Farnham 2007).6 But there was something genuinely new about the way the major proponents of biodiversity – people like Wilson and Norman Myers – mobilized interest in protecting not one or a few individual species or habitats, but the entire diverse global ecosystem itself. Biodiversity, in other words, helped make diversity a normative value.

1986, the 'biodiversity movement' *formally began*, refering to the [1986 National Forum on BioDiversity](🗓️%20biodiv--a%20rough%20list%20of%20events.md#1986%20National%20Forum%20on%20BioDiversity).

> The reasons for this are many and complex, but I will point to a few:

There are several reasons by which, [from the mid-20c 'biodiversity' became a normative concept and a "vital resource" for mankind](from%20the%20mid-20c%20'biodiversity'%20became%20a%20normative%20concept%20and%20a%20%22vital%20resource%22%20for%20mankind.md):  
  - ecologists emphasized more the fragile interconnectedness of ecosystems, and the importance of all taxa in having an reaching an stable habitat.  
  - move towards utilitarian arguments in conservation and environmentalism.  
  - the degradation of the natural environment sped up, linked to a demographic expansion of Western societies. The consequences of antrhopogenic effects on the environment became clearer.  
  - the arguments supporting environmental care focused more on unforeseen consequences (there may be a link towards risk and #latermodernity here)  
   - despite the unforeseen consequences, biologists started to develop tools and aquire data to be able to predict these consequences.

> biologists interested in conservation efforts became aware of the new science of extinction and its consequences, which gave them both a sense of the scope of the current crisis, and also tools and data with which to predict its consequences.


> The fact that mass extinctions can and do occur, and that they have dramatic short and long-term consequences for diversity, has contributed a greatly enhanced sense of impending danger that was absent in earlier conservation rhetoric.

> first conference on biodiversity was held in 1986, Raup presented a paper on “Diversity Crises in the Geological Past,” which appeared as the fifth chapter in the massive published proceedings (Wilson 1988a).


> As David Takacs has pointed out, during the 1980s and 1990s, the biodiversity movement brought about a new way of seeing, and valuing, natural diversity that embodied not only scientists’ interpretations of empirical evidence, but also their “political, emotional, aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual feelings” (Takacs 1996, 1 [1996-Takacs](1996-Takacs.md)). Biological diversity came to be seen, by scientists, policy makers, and the general public, not just as important for ecological survival or medical and economic development, but as something “good” in itself.

> As Takacs again observes, “as biologists link themselves with the forces promoting the multicultural ethic that has made normative and political headway in our society, different kinds of diversity thus become symbiotically and metaphysically linked in inherent ‘goodness’” (Takacs 1996, 43). He is not alone in drawing this conclusion. David Heyd argues that “cultural diversity is but one manifestation of the culture of diversity, the other being biodiversity,” and he contends that “it is by no means a coincidence that despite the different origins of the two movements, their evolution took place more or less simultaneously” (Heyd 2010, 160). 

The attention of scientists to BIOdiversity and its framing as something necessarily 'good' was also linked to a cultural time where societies started to value other kinds of CULTURAL diversity.

> One of the clearest examples of the overlap between valuations of biological and cultural diversity is in the rhetoric used by the United Nations and UNESCO to promote these ideals. A few years after the initial biodiversity conference was held in Washington, an “Earth Summit” was held in Rio de Janeiro where 150 nations signed the United Nations’ “Convention on Biological Diversity,” which explicitly called attention to “the intrinsic value of biological diversity” (UN 1992, 1). A decade later, UNESCO produced the “Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity,” which framed cultural diversity in the same language of “resource” in which biological diversity was being presented: “The Declaration aims both to preserve cultural diversity as a living, and thus renewable treasure that must not be perceived as being unchanging but as a process guaranteeing the survival of humanity”

year? UNESCO produces the "Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity" which also framed cultural diversity as a "resource" [2001 UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity](🗓️%20biodiv--a%20rough%20list%20of%20events.md#2001%20UNESCO%20Universal%20Declaration%20on%20Cultural%20Diversity).

> new term – “biocultural diversity” – at around the same time. The term seems to have been first coined at a 1996 conference held in Berkeley that was jointly sponsored by UNESCO, the World Wildlife Fund, and the newly founded organization Terralingua (which is devoted to preservation of endangered languages) on “Endangered Languages, Endangered Knowledge, Endangered Environments” (Maffi 2001b). Papers from the conference were published in a volume titled *On Biocultural Diversity*, and reflect the way in which key elements of the biological understanding of extinction and diversity influenced discussions of cultural and linguistic endangerment. A

> This conflation of biological and cultural diversity is nowhere more evident than in a UNESCO booklet published in 2003 titled Sharing a World of Difference: The Earth’s Linguistic, Cultural, and Biological Diversity. This document defines biocultural diversity as “interlinkages between linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity,” and asserts that “the diversity of life on Earth is formed not only by the variety of plant and animal species and ecosystems found in nature (biodiversity), but also by the variety of cultures and languages in human society (cultural and linguistic diversity)” (Skutnabb-Kangas et al. 2003, 9).

[2003 UNESCO booklet Sharing a World of Difference The Earth’s Linguistic Cultural and Biological Diversity](🗓️%20biodiv--a%20rough%20list%20of%20events.md#2003%20UNESCO%20booklet%20Sharing%20a%20World%20of%20Difference%20The%20Earth’s%20Linguistic%20Cultural%20and%20Biological%20Diversity).

> a basic pattern is clear: during the 19th century, at a time when naturalists understood nature to be an essentially endlessly renewable resource, diversity was taken for granted, and extinction was not perceived as a threat to the economy of nature, and diversity per se did not have normative value. Rather, extinction was understood to be nature’s way of strengthening and improving itself by weeding out the unfit, and competition was celebrated as the source of natural progress. This view, of course, supported Victorian ideologies of social progress and imperial expansion, and justified a lack of concern about the inevitable victims of progress (combined with, at most, romantic nostalgia for cultures that passed away). When competition is natural, extinction is inevitable, and not to be resisted.

Summary

> We now live in a society where cultural and biological diversity are considered to be precious resources, and where threats to those resources are perceived from all directions. We fundamentally value diversity – as an inherent normative good – in a way that previous Western societies did not. This is partially due, I have argued, to a new extinction discourse in which biologists 1) understood extinction as a potentially catastrophic and irreversible process, 2) characterized extinction explicitly in terms of its effect on diversity, and 3) no longer conceptualized survival as a “fair game,” with extinction penalizing only those individuals and species that “deserve” it.

> There is obviously an important sense in which scientists have themselves been influenced by changing cultural norms; it is quite likely that the new understanding of extinction was made more acceptable by a cultural and political context in which nuclear proliferation and environmental catastrophe were looming specters (Hamblin 2013). After all, Cuvier’s view of extinction, which was not terribly different from the current paleontological view, was considered anathema by the scientific establishment of Victorian Britain for reasons that extended well beyond the empirical

Not only have scientists influenced other scientists (ecology, paleontology, linguists, conservation biologists), but the cultural context also influenced how biodiversity is conceptualised and valued.   

The best evidence of this is that Cuvier's ideas (which aren't very different from ours) were not taken up, probably because they were in direct opposition to Victorian views of progress and nature as essentially balanced.
