Two kinds of studies:
- locally-involved community of scientists, associating with with different stakeholders (NGOs, local communities, local politicians) to address biodiversity crisis
- policy-oriented science advocacy: from consensus building at the level of the academic community, to the writing of reports addressed to a variety of stakeholders. 



Study:
- knowledge circulation
- implementation of scientific knowledge
- success?
