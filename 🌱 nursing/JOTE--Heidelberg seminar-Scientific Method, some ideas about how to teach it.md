A good idea could be to lay clear the multiple dimensions of 'scientific method', and how each element can vary. We could ask for what do we mean when we speak of scientific method. We speak of:
- observations (data)
- experimentation (data)
- making hypothesis
- testing
- communicating
- (mechanical) explanation
- mathematization
- ...

I could then look at the different ways those things can vary (historically, in terms of discipline), followed by a more meta-discussion: a discussion on the plural, socially-constructed yet vital and with an ethical dimension nature of the scientific method.
