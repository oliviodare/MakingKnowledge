# Teaching ideas

A good idea could be to lay clear the multiple dimensions of 'scientific method', and how each element can vary. We could ask for what do we mean when we speak of scientific method. We speak of:
- observations (data)
- experimentation (data)
- making hypothesis
- testing
- communicating
- (mechanical) explanation
- mathematization
- ...

I could then look at the different ways those things can vary (historically, in terms of discipline), followed by a more meta-discussion: a discussion on the plural, socially-constructed yet vital and with an ethical dimension nature of the scientific method.

Having taught students about the plurality of the scientific method (pluralism here understood as that there are different elements about the scientific method that depending on the historical period get highlighted or pushed to the background), I could use [2020-Yanai and Lercher](2020-Yanai%20and%20Lercher.md)' and [2021-Felin et al](2021-Felin%20et%20al.md)'s discussion and ask the students what sort of (ideal) 'type' of scientists are each group: do they conform to the current norm or are they attempting a shift in what we understand the scientific method to be? In this way, we can get a sense of what each student thinks is the current standard, the current 'focus'.
