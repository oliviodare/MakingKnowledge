# Questions arising


## Biology

_What are cladistic analyses?_

_What are sister taxa?_

_What other concepts is ‘biodiversity’ associated with?_

_What fields used it first and in which scientific and political contexts?(Paleontology, Conservation Biology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology)_

_How is and was biodiversity measured, and depending on each field?_

_What is (global) stratigraphy?_

_What is the “pull of the Recent”?_



## History

_Synchronic, diachronic historical analysis?_
