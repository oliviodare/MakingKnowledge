# where can conceptual ambiguity of 'biodiveristy' come from?
#conceptnote 

Biodiversity both means different things and is measured in different ways. This flexibility can come from:
- What in biology is diverse about (the argument of looking for the 'surrogate' in [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md) ). As he put it, diversity can be at "every level of complexity" ("entities and processes"), it can refer to:
	> (i) a spatial (or generalized ecological) hierarchy starting from biological molecules and macromolecules, through cell organelles, cells, individuals, populations (demes) and meta-populations, communities, ecosystems, (communities and their physical habitats) ultimately to the biosphere; and a taxonomic hierarchy from alleles through loci, linkage groups, genotypes, subspecies, species, genera, families, orders, classes, phyla and kingdoms
	- Species diversity, with the consequent #speciesproblem , as discussed in [2017-Garnett and Christidis](2017-Garnett%20and%20Christidis.md), [2013-Reydon](2013-Reydon.md), [2019-Conix](2019-Conix.md)
	- Invididual diversity
	- Group diversity
	- Community diversity
	- Genetic diviersity
	- Complexity diversity

- Locality (also talked about in [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md))


Despite the flexibily that these categories introduce, we should also pay attention to the temporal changes in the meanings of diversity: [diversity is at the core of conservation biology but its meanings have changed](diversity%20is%20at%20the%20core%20of%20conservation%20biology%20but%20its%20meanings%20have%20changed.md).
