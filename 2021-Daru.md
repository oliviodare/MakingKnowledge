**Take-home message**: This study supports the idea that climate does not interact with every living organism in the same way, and that "ecological studies should use systems tailored for each taxonomic group" (p. 2). It supports a pluralistic idea of classification of climate: each taxonomic groups is differently affected by climate and thus there is no *one* way to classify the climate (previously it was plant-based classification of climate). 

However, what i am less clear about why is this relation established: Is it to predict decreased tetrapods biodiversity or changes in climate? And in a more general note, [how are classification systems used, by who?](how%20are%20classification%20systems%20used,%20by%20who?.md) And [what is the process like (and how long does it take) since the scientific design of classification systems to their use in governance?](what%20is%20the%20process%20like%20(and%20how%20long%20does%20it%20take)%20since%20the%20scientific%20design%20of%20classification%20systems%20to%20their%20use%20in%20governance?.md)

## Highlights and notes
> “Variations in the Earth’s climate can be used to predict where in the world a species is most likely to inhabit (Woodward et al., 2004; Higgins et al., 2016). Identifying the impact climate has on biodiversity is important for understanding how different species will respond to global climate change (Bellard et al., 2012; Rock and Daru, 2021). ” (Daru, 2021, p. 1)

> “The Ko ̈ ppen system classifies the Earth’s climate into distinct zones based on the vegetation that grows in each region (Ko ̈ ppen, 1923). This system is based on the assumption that plant distributions are closely linked to climate (Olson et al., 2001). ” (Daru, 2021, p. 1) 

Quite an old system, wondering how/if it evolved. The issue of plants once more.

> “Now, in eLife, Joaquı ́n Calatayud and coworkers, who are based at Umea ̊ University and Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, report a new set of climate regions based on an analysis of 26,000 species of tetrapods, including birds, amphibians, mammals and reptiles (Calatayud et al., 2021). Tetrapods were chosen for this study because their distributions and evolutionary relationships are well known, and because their home ranges and dispersal abilities are different. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 1) 

Now tetrapods: wondering how species richness mesaures and species delimitation differs between plants and animals e.g., tetrapods.

> “To determine the local climate of each species, Calatayud et al. calculated the water level (measured as annual rainfall) and energy level (estimated as the amount of evaporation that occurs each month) of their home range: this means, for example, that a tropical rainforest would be a region with high water and energy levels. Calatayud et al. hypothesized that the geographical location of different climates accounts for most of the geographical variation in tetrapod distributions. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 1) 

Hypothesis: climate conditions -> varation distribution

> “This revealed 16 distinct climate regions, some of which differ from the regions classified using the Ko ̈ ppen system. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 1) 

Divergence with the older system.

> “Most of these mismatched regions had different species of tetrapods than the regions in the Ko ̈ ppen system, which suggests that variations in climate may impact the distribution of animals differently to plants” (Daru, 2021, p. 1)

> “Common approaches for the classification of climate regions are well suited for detecting abrupt changes in climate (Kottek et al., 2006), but may fail to detect more gradual transitions. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 2) 

Which makes me wonder --> what is the function of this new hypothesis of the connection between tetrapod variation & climate? Is it to predict decreased tetrapods biodiversity or changes in climate?

> “Lastly, Calatayud et al. also found that similar climate regions had similar tetrapod populations, even if they were thousands of miles apart (such as the Amazonian and African rainforests), but there were exceptions: for example, species living in the Australian desert differed from those in the Namib desert or Horn of Africa, despite all three locations being deserts with similar climates (Figure 1). This implies that climate alone is insufficient to account for all patterns of species distribution and abundance, and other variables – such as geographical barriers, colonization abilities, or differences in evolutionary history – may also limit the spread of a species. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 2) 

Reminds me of Darwin's “economy of nature” but illustrates how trait adaptations isn't the only things that drives evolution: e.g., phylogenetic histories too.

> “this study challenges the idea of using the same climate classification for multiple organisms, and suggests ecological studies should use systems tailored for each taxonomic group. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 2) 

Ahá, this is the importance of it! It supports plurality in biodiversity measures (taxonomy-based plurality)!

> “Further analyses of climate classification might also help identify climate regions that are the result of human activities, causing organisms to spread into new environments, or native species to go extinct. ” (Daru, 2021, p. 2)
