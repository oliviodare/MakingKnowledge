## Reading notes

> The development of novel endeavors of knowledge production involves changes in societal as well as in epistemic structures, just as the emergence of the natural sciences at large, in the sense discussed in the previous chapter, was simultaneously an epistemic and a societal transformation on a global scale. In the following, I therefore examine this **cotransformation** or **coevolution** of social and epistemic structures in greater detail.<sup>1</sup> For this purpose, I make use of a specific tool that I must adapt to this context: **social network analysis**. (p. 301)

The starting point for this chapter is the different mechanisms by which the social and epistemic structure change, and in turn, how the change and are dependent on each other. Endnote <sup>1</sup> refers to the work in social network analysis used in history (SNA) in which this chapter is based: 
- **A history of knowledge primer**: Renn and Hyman (2012), 'The Globalization of Knowledge in History: An Introduction' in *The Globalization of Knowledge in History*, http://edition-open-access.de/studies/1/5/index.html.

- **Example of the method being used in the early modern history of science**: Valleriani (2017), 'The Tracts of the Sphere: Knowledge Restructured over a Network' in *The Structures of Practical Knowledge*

> Its [social network analysis] reach is still limited because of the complex mathematical and conceptual problems of modeling the interaction of social networks with the more stable economic, political, and societal underpinnings of these networks, which **change on different timescales**. New approaches in multilevel network analysis aim at taking these complex interactions into account, but many of their aspects are still under investigation.<sup>2</sup> Thus, the use of network analysis for a historical theory of knowledge evolution is breaking new ground; hence, some of the material presented in the following is still in a preliminary state. (p. 301)

There is a methodological and fundamental limit to SNA: representing different timescales. The footnote refers to:
- Lazega and Snijders, eds. (2016), *Multilevel Network Analysis for the Social Sciences: Theory, Methods and Applications*.

> It [SNA] opens up a relational perspective on societal and mental process, making it possible to investigate knowledge evolution and overall changes of knowledge structures into the same theoretical framework, and what is more, into a framework that allows for quantitative analysis. (p. 302)

An answer to *why* SNA may be useful: [social network analysis draws relations between different levels of analysis in historically-changing systems](social%20network%20analysis%20draws%20relations%20between%20different%20levels%20of%20analysis%20in%20historically-changing%20systems.md). As well, [social network analysis in History can be formal and quantitative](social%20network%20analysis%20in%20History%20can%20be%20formal%20and%20quantitative.md). 

> Quantitative network analyses of historical processes, going beyond the metaphorical use of network concepts, have only recently been pursued more intensly, combining network analysis with historical interpretation.<sup>7</sup> (p. 302)

This footnote refers to some examples of this kind of work:
- Preiser-Kapeller (2015), 'Harbours and Maritime Networks as Complex Adaptive Systems' in *Harbourgs and Maritine Netowrks as Complex Adaptive Systems: A Thematic Introduction*.
- Laubichler, Maienschein, and Renn (2013), 'Computational Perspectives in the History of Science: To the Memory of Peter Damerow', *Isis*.
- Lemercier (2015), 'Formal Network Methods in History: Why and How?' in *Social Networks, Political Institutinos, and Rural Societies*
- Düring (2017), 'Historical Network Research: Network Analysis in the Historical Disciplines'. https://historicalnetworkresearch.org

Until now, SNA has been used to analyse concrete historical cases, restricted to one level of analysis. In Renn's project of the evolution of knowledge, he aims at connecting different levels of his 'epistemic networks' (defined as "social networks involving the transmission and transformation of knowledge", p. 302). 

> Let me introduce a few basic notions, terminologies, and studies in social network analysis that are particularly helpful to outline a historical theory of knowledge evolution. (p. 303)

To start with: [there are several analytical components in social network analysis](there%20are%20several%20analytical%20components%20in%20social%20network%20analysis.md). 

> If we are to combine the instruments of social network theory with an analysis of the dimensions and dynamics of knowledge evolution, we must pursue a more fine-grained description of these netowrks. Epistemic networks have (just like knowledge) social, material, and mental dimensions, which are closelhy interwined. These dimensions are represented by distinct networks, which I call social semiotic, and semantic networks in the following. (p. 305)

I've decided to make a graphic representation of Renn's description of SNA applied to a theory of the evolution of knowledge. One important question remains: [[how do the different dimensions in social network analysis map onto each other?]]

> The examples of the coevolution of systems of knowledge and epistemic communities discussed in this chapter suggest that network analysis, suitably adapted to a history of knowledge, can be helfpul in linking micro- and macro-history, as well as diachronic and transveral approaches to the development and spread of knowledge. Network analysis may, at first glance, appear to be merely a reformulation of familiar historical processes veiled in sophisticated language. But it can actually serve to combine the precision of micro-history grounded in "thick" description of historical contexts with the sweeping generalizations of global history by validating such generalizations through richt historical data, their interpretations, and the mathematical analsysis of their relations. (p. 319)

The combined SNA and global history of knowledge evolutions suggested by Renn has the possibility of represent complex relatinos between different historical processes and elements, each of them with their own timescales. The aspect about 'rich data' and 'thick descriptions' is discussed below (see [Components and some characteristics of a network](there%20are%20several%20analytical%20components%20in%20social%20network%20analysis.md#Components%20and%20some%20characteristics%20of%20a%20network) for descriptions of 'rich' and 'poor' data and other components of SNA):

> The data required for such an approach are perhaps not typically Big Data, in the sense of the natural sciences, but they are certainly "rich data." Rich data are essential to the computational humanities, which still fall behind in the exploitation of such data, compared, for instance, with bioinformatics, which deals with similar problems. Rich data are often quantitatively more substantial than the data relevant to a typical historical case study and qualitativey more refined and contextualized than the Big Data of many social sciences, in part because in history, the outcome of change processes is often known. Rich data are characterized by a high number of attributes and are typically very heterogeneous. Many network models, in contrast, are developed for data defined by a low number of attributes. 

The idea of 'rich data', as multifaceted ("high number of attributes", "thick descriptions") data points, is very interesting, and serves as a way to justify and explain how SNA is able to track dynamic relations in between nodes and edges at levels of analysis with changing timescales. 

> An intriguing feature of epistemic networks is their self-referential character, that is, the historical actors' realizations that they participate in a specific network activity may shape their thinking and acting, and  thus influence, in turn, the network activity itself. This realization can act as a turning point in the emergence of regulative structures operating on a network, as the examples of calendar reform and the renaissance of general relativity illustrate. It may be considered an acto of collective relfexivity. The understanding of such acts typically require a mixed approach: a combinatino of traditional scholarly analysis and interpretation with novel quantitiative methods directed at dealing with the complexity of the underlying interactions. 

Renn argues that SNA can shed light on how [[collective reflexivity can be a mechanism of regulation of (epistemic) social networks]]. He argues that *awareness* of belonging to a given network (e.g., to a collective identity or a given social strucutre with several labor-differentiation aimed at a particular goal) can modulate the network itself (by, for instance, strenghtening some social connections, or encouraging the pursuit of certain material or semiotic elements).
