### Responsibilities as copy-editor
What does the copy-editor do?

When a copy-editor is commissioned, we expect him/her to:

-   use the Microsoft Word Track Changes feature while editing;
-   check for and correct errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation;
-   check for consistency in the author’s choice of words, punctuation and general style;
-  query any potentially libellous statements with the author and bring them to the PE’s attention if necessary;
-   tag the manuscript clearly for the typesetter to follow, so that levels of heading, extracts, lists, boxes, tables, figures, notes and references and any display matter are all easily identified for setting;
-   check that notes and/or references are complete and consistent and query any with you that appear to be incorrect;
-   check that the note indicator numbering sequence is correct;
-   address lists of queries direct to the author and insert the author’s answers ( queries will be prepared in one or more batches, please return your answers to the copy-editor within a week or so of receipt of any queries);
-   If any queries are outstanding, the copy-editor will confirm this with your PE; provide a list of running heads for your approval;
-   check the captions for figures if you, as the author or editor, have not supplied these check whether the list of contents is consistent with the actual contents in the text; that the list of illustrations is complete and consistent with the contents; that the list of contributors (if applicable) is complete, consistent and in alphabetical order;
-   check whether any material appears to be missing;
-   return the edited manuscript, lists and forms, plus all correspondence with the author (so that we don’t waste time querying something that has already been checked).
    

Please note: as is the case with all new titles, the typescript as submitted to Editorial is assumed to be the final version so material should not be added or deleted at this point. It is subject only to amendment at the copy-edit stage when the copy-editor reviews the typescript. Accordingly, it is not part of our procedure to return the edited manuscript to you for review prior to typesetting. However, the copy-editor will query suggested changes with you before enacting them.

Once the copy-editor has incorporated your answers, the edited manuscript will be returned to the Production Editor or Project Manager for checking and can be prepared for and sent to the typesetters.

The typesetter will flow the text into the design agreed with Editorial as appropriate for your book and produce a set of proofs as a PDF document.

### General rules of copyediting, discussed with Dupré

*Method*
Work with BJ's file using track-changes, export second final version

*Current authors*
~~Kinseher --> still at BJ
Hoeniger --> not sent to BJ, may be work with uniformity of titles
Von der Goltz --> back with the author, there were some minor issues that needed check --> received them from BJ~~

*General editing*
Check style sheet, if not explictly stated --> check Author Guidelines --> make a decision and record it (e.g., only accept footnotes at the end of the sentences, O'Grady --> something weird about citation).

---

### Making all ready for submission

*Images*
~~According to MS (past managing editor), all images permission, quality, and captions are there --> need to double-check and send to BJ (not necessarily for language but style)~~

*Final Routledge submission*
Routledge contact person: Katlyin Armstrong (may have to correspond with her instead of SD for some issues)

They need a polished text files, and images (need to check author guidelines for details).


 

## 'The Making of Technique in the Art’ (Brepols)


### Current Issues
-   No transition document
-   Images: 
	-   double check list of illustrations, clearing status not known
	-   Some images actually missing
  
### Roadmap

-   Submit to Brepols by May 1st. Chapters (text and images) should be clean are clear by then.
-    Alexander Sterkens (alexander.sterkens@brepols.net), Acquisitions Editor at Brepols) will probably would send it to peer-review.
