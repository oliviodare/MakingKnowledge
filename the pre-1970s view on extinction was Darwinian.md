# the pre-1970s view on 'extinction' was Darwinian
#conceptnote

The Darwin and pre-1970s 'biodiversity crisis view'.

Extinction as:

1.  slow and gradual
2.  balanced with the birth of new species
3.  progressive (death as a productive life force)


As such, 'biodiversity' was not an independent value in biology as we have today (see [nineteenth-c views on 'extinction' were characterised by a strong idea of the 'balance of nature', which conceptualised it as a fair, inevitable, and gradual phenomena](nineteenth-c%20views%20on%20'extinction'%20were%20characterised%20by%20a%20strong%20idea%20of%20the%20'balance%20of%20nature',%20which%20conceptualised%20it%20as%20a%20fair,%20inevitable,%20and%20gradual%20phenomena.md) for more historical detail on the relation between 'extinction' and 'biodiversity').
