**Take-home message**: The history of seed banks tells the paradoxical position of plant breeders and scientists. Their concers of diminshing crop diversity emerged in the context of plans for furthering an industrial approach to agriculture. The reflexivity of the knowledge about diversity, in this case, looks like this: the knowledge that helped create higher yield crops (i.e., industrial agriculture) is also the knowledge that contributes to the understanding that reliance on them is dangerous. In a larger, institutional sense, we see that the field of conservation and the process of industrialisation are entangled: the advancement of both depended on each other (industrial agriculture depended of on conservation activities and tools, and conservation activities were funded in the context of projects that aimed at developing agricultural practice into an industrial approach).

## Reading notes







> By the 1970s, agriculturalists fretted as much about the increased vulnerability of narrowly bred, high-yielding commercial varieties in a world with decreased 'genetic resources' as they did about disappearance of so-called indigenous varieties and landraces themselves. Both could be seen as endangered.

The fear of losing crop genetic diversity started in the early 20th century, as the "reliance on improved commercial varieties became the norm". Those commercial varieties gave higher yields, but there was a fear that a focus on those would neglect those other varieties with "potentially useful traits" in the future.

> In this paper, I explore how knowledge of this dilemma—that is, the reliance of industrial agriculture on genetic diversity that it tends itself to destroy—shaped efforts to conserve biological diversity and simultaneously shaped the landscapes and genescapes of twentieth-century agriculture.

The link to late modernity is clear. There is a knowledge reflexivity: the knowledge that helped create those higher yield crops (i.e., industrial agriculture) is also the knowledge that contributes to the understanding that reliance on them is dangerous.

> As with Harlan and Martini, many breeders' preferred solution to the possible loss of potentially valuable genetic types was not to maintain these in cultivation but to gather seeds of these varieties and arrange for their indefinite storage at seed storage facilities, today called 'seed banks' or 'genebanks'.

The answer to that worry was a sort of 'encyclopedic' answer: the preferred knowledge was a theoretical one (in the form of the bank to which anybody could in principle at some point access), not a practical one (the cultivation itself kept on going in the direction of industrial agriculture).

> Here I examine the dual role of seed banks as agricultural technologies, emerging after World War II as essential elements of the technological assemblage of industrial agricultural production, and as conservation tools, envisioned as the best way to prevent the loss of endangered agricultural plants.

Seed banks as 'agricultural technologies' and 'conservation tools'.

> The history of biological conservation recounts the struggles of scientists, especially in the later twentieth century, against this very industrialization and homogenization, of efforts to save unique plants, animals, and ecosystems wherever their existence has been threatened.


> On the other hand, it is a history of biological conservation that calls attention to how conservation might underwrite further industrialization and in fact hasten the destruction of living biodiversity, including through the promotion of new technological solutions.

Not all conservation has achieved it main intention (reducing the destruction of biodiversity). The case exposed here is an example of how a technological solution (here seed banks) may contribute to the industrial approach to agriculture.

> This in turn posed a practical concern for future breeding projects. For example, if a new pathogen were to threaten common maize varieties, where would breeders look for traits that might potentially confer resistance to that pathogen? Loss of diversity meant fewer avenues for breeders to pursue, which in turn meant increased vulnerability for crops and, ultimately, farmers.

The main fear was a Darwinian one: what if the environment changes, and it threatens the survival of a homogenous species?

> The USDA, acting on the growing awareness of the trend toward uniformity and its consequences, initiated a 'New Crops' program in the late 1940s that aimed to bring in 'crop germ plasm' from around the world, to evaluate this germ plasm, and to maintain it.15 The latter was a novel step for the USDA, which had had global collectors for a long time but never a system for the permanent maintenance of collected items. At nearly the same time, the government provided funds for collecting the early open-pollinated maize varieties of the United States, assumedly because they were recognized to be both useful and rapidly disappearing.16 In 1950, a joint USDA and state experiment stations committee formally advocated the creation of a 'national seed storage unit' that would ensure that 'the national responsibility for the conservation of valuable germ plasm' would not be neglected as it sometimes had in the past.


History:  
  
1. development of high-yielding crops from the 1930s.  
2. A homogeneity in maize crops is established by the early 1940s.  
3. Fear by breeders and scientists of the lack of diversity throughout the 1940s  
  
4. Importation of foreign seeds and creation of national seed banks by the late 1940s.  
5. 'Maize Committee' of NRC launches project of long-term storage of genetic diversity in the early 1950s.


> A close examination of its unfolding illustrates how and why the creation of seed storage facilities, or seed banks, became the go-to solution for the problem of maintaining plant genetic diversity.

The problem of lose of diversity was framed as and reduced to be an encyclopedic problem, to be solved by establishment of seed banks.

> The publication of these studies, in Spanish in 1951 and in English in 1952 as Races of Maize in Mexico, was intended both to elucidate the evolutionary history of maize in Mexico and to make the collection a more useful resource for scientists and breeders across the Americas. It also identified a looming problem. The authors recognized that maize-breeding programs in Mexico, if successful, would produce types to replace the many diverse landraces they now encountered. Without farmers to grow these many historic and prehistoric strains of maize, and to save the seed from year to year, they would be lost. And they would be lost not only to Mexican farmers, but to breeders like themselves who relied on such diversity to carry out their work.

The studies aimed at tracing the gather and classify samples of maize. The high diversity they reported was also a source of concern: diversity may get lost due to the EEUU-led breeding programmes.

> In other words, these researchers recognized the tangled relationship between their efforts to transform agricultural production and the imperative to conserve biological resources. Genetic diversity in crop plants was needed for the creation of improved varieties. But the success of these improved varieties in turn threatened genetic diversity, and demanded that efforts be made to protect such diversity so that crop improvement could continue in the future. The cycle was one that seemed likely to intensify. The greater the success in creating and disseminating improved varieties, the greater the threat to diversity, and therefore the greater the efforts at conservation that would have to be made.

The scientific reflexivity, in this specific context. #latemodernity  
  
1. diversity needed to construct 'the good crop'  
2. 'the good crop' threatens that diversity.

> The Maize Committee decided that it would ensure continued access for breeders and other researchers to this crucial resource, genetic diversity, via the still-novel agricultural technology of dedicated long-term seed storage facilities. From its members' perspective, one would not want to stop the transition of Latin American farmers to higheryielding varieties. To do so would certainly stem the tide of varietal loss it perceived as threating. But this transition was seen as an inevitable—indeed, desirable!—change, one that would increase agricultural production across the region. Because the committee members wanted to encourage this agricultural shift, long-term or indefinite preservation of varieties as seed in centralized seed storage facilities appeared to be the only solution: a much-needed additional element of the technological system that undergird agricultural production.

If I understood correctly, the scientists of the Maize Committee were at a crossroads. Althought they were aware that moving into the direction of industrial agriculture would reduce the diversity, that option was not viable as they do wanted to encourage this shift in production approach. And so, preservation by long-term storage was seen as the only viable solution.

> Perhaps one reason the Maize Committee was unable to convince funders to lay down resources for its Seed Centers was that these represented an as-yet untested technology. In the eyes of committee members and other collaborators, the need to preserve the extant diversity in maize was both obvious and pressing.

There were both economic (inability to obtain long-term funding) and scientific (uncertainty in the understanding of how to best preserve and use the collection of seeds) challenges in the preservation of the seeds. While the collection was relatively straight-forward, the *long-term* preservation wasn't.

> What temperature and humidity would extend seed life the longest? How would renewal of collections, which required growing out a portion of an accession and allowing it to interbreed, affect their genetic composition? Was it necessary to maintain each accession of the thousands made, or would genetic diversity be equally well preserved in pooling accessions from across regions that were deemed to be of the same original 'race'? These and many other questions were mostly up for grabs.


> What remained common to all of the proposals and counter-proposals that came before CGIAR was the assumption that collecting and maintaining crop varieties as seed in secure storage facilities would be the primary means of preventing the loss of plant genetic resources. The seed bank had achieved ascendancy, and was agreed upon as a technology essential to the continued success of world agriculture. Seed banks would subsequently be granted a central role in the international conservation efforts undertaken by a new International Board for Plant Genetic Resources, which was created under the auspices of CGIAR in 1973 and continues today (through a successor organization, Bioversity International) to be a leading organization in the management of global agricultural biodiversity.


> For example, this brief glance at the history of seed banking calls attention to the entanglement of industrial agriculture and global efforts to conserve biological diversity. The former is typically characterized by its dependence on genetically uniform crops and its ecologically destructive methods, and the latter as a struggle to mitigate the ill consequences of these and other industrial activities that destroy diversity—a struggle against the very forces that set global industrialized agriculture in motion. But industrial agriculture not only generated certain conservation concerns, it was also dependent (or its advocates came to see it as dependent) on conservation activities and tools.

Conservation and Industrialisation are entangled.
