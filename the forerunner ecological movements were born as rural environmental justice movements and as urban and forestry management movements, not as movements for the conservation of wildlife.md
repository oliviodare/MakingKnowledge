# the forerunner ecological movements were born as rural environmental justice movements and as urban and forestry management movements, not as movements for the conservation of wildlife

[2001-Martínez Alier](2001-Martínez%20Alier.md) recounts the case of copper mine conflics between the mine owners and the miners and farmers, who didn't fight for wildlife conservation, but for improved workplace conditions (miners) and land protection and against contamination in rice fields (farmers). These social fights were done in the context of and against the "national context of industrialization and militarism." ([2001-Martínez Alier](2001-Martínez%20Alier.md), p. 292).

This supports the idea that the anti-industrialization attitude of conservation biology ([conservation biologists are aware and critical of industrialisation](conservation%20biologists%20are%20aware%20and%20critical%20of%20industrialisation.md)) is a heritage of these 'social' fights.
