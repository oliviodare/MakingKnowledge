## Highlights and notes
> “*A new synthetic discipline addresses the dynamics and problems of perturbed species, communities, and ecosystems*.” (Soulé, 1985, p.727) 

I guess this is one of the earliest definitions (1985) of conservation biology. Curious about the meaning of 'synthethic' here.

> “Conservation biology, a new stage in the application of science to conservation problems, addresses the biology of species, communities,and ecosystems that are perturbed,either directly or indirectly, by human activities or other agents. Its goal is to provide principles and tools for preserving biological diversity” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)


> “I also point out that ethical norms are a genuine part of conservation biology, as they are in all mission- or crisis-oriented disciplines” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)


>“Its relation to biology, particularly ecology, is analogous to that of surgery to physiology and war to political science” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)


I've seen this metaphor before, perhaps [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md).
[conservation biolgy is a mission-driven science](conservation%20biolgy%20is%20a%20mission-driven%20science.md)


> “In crisis disciplines, one must act before knowing all the facts; crisis disciplines are thus a mixture of science and art, and their pursuit requires intuition as well as information,” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)

Interesting definition of "crisis discipline" --> everything that isn't science and or information is art and intuition

> “Tolerating uncertainty is often necessary” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)


> “Conservation biologists are being asked for advice by government agencies and private organizations on such problems as the ecological and health consequences of chemical pollution, the introduction of exotic species and artificially produced strains of existing organisms.” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)


> “For political reasons, such decisions must often be made in haste. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.727)


> “Finally, this figure illustrates the dependence of the biological sciences on social science disciplines. Today, for example, any recommendations about the location and size of nation parks should consider the impact of the park on indigenous peoples and their cultures, on the local economy, and on opportunity costs such as forfeited logging profits” (Soulé, 1985, p.727+1)


curious to see how this actually plays out. [how did the social sciences enter conservation biology?](how%20did%20the%20social%20sciences%20enter%20conservation%20biology?.md)

> “There is much overlap between conservation biology and the natural resource fields, especially fisheries biology, forestry, and wildlife management. Nevertheless, two characteristics of these fields often distinguish them from conservation biology. The first is the dominance in the resource fields of utilitarian, economic objectives. Even though individual wildlife biologists honor Aldo Leopold's land ethic and the intrinsic value of nature, most of the financial resources for management must go to enhancing commercial and recreational values for humans. The emphasis is on *our* natural *resources*”
> The second distinguishing characteristic is the nature of these resources. For the most part, they are a small number of particularly valuable target species (e.g., trees, fishes, deer, and waterfowl)-a tiny fraction of the total biota. This distinction is beginning to disappear, however, as some natural resource agencies become more "ecological" and because conservationbiologistsfrequentlyfocuson individualendangered, critical, or keystonespecies.  (Soulé, 1985, p.728)


[[what are the different ideal type approaches to Nature in conservation biology and related fields?]] Conservation biology is defined here in contrast to other disciplines such as fisheries biology and forestry. They put the emphasis that these other disciplines of management do not operate on aesthetic or intrinsic values but on "commercial" and "recreational" incentives. With this and the previous paragraph, it makes me think that it could be a good idea for me to take #idealtypes of the different reasons for attending/conserving a given environment (commercial, recreational, ethical, aesthetic, indigenous use...), which could be a good way to conceptually map approaches to Nature (alhtough I am sure this has been done). In this way, I can take a #conceptualhistory appraoch and see the diachronic structures that allow, for instance, the cognitive separation of commercial from indigenous use, or the aesthetic from the "holistic"; and how use and profit relate to each other given the lingustic pre-givens, to use Koselleck's terms.

> “Conservationbiology tends to be holistic, in two senses of the word” (Soulé, 1985, p.728)

> “ecological and evolutionary processes must be studied at their own macroscopic levels and that reductionism alone cannot lead to explanations of community and ecosystem processes such as body-size differences among species in guilds ” (Soulé, 1985, p.728)


This seems to have changed from what [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md) said --> species richness (a reductionist approach) is a good indication (shortcut, given practical constraints) for studying biodiversty


> “Holism is not mysticism. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.728)


> “The second implication of the term *holistic* is the assumption that multidisciplinary approaches will ultimately be the most fruitful. Conservation biology is certainly holistic in this sense” (Soulé, 1985, p.728)


It adds "biogeograhic analysis," "population genetics," among others disciplines that make conservation biology holistic



> “Longterm viability of natural communities usually implies the persistence of diversity, with little or no help from humans. But for the foreseeable future, such a passive role for managers is unrealistic, and virtually all conservation programs will need to be buttressed artificially” (Soulé, 1985, p.728)

[[conservation is a management science that has to deal with uncertainty]]

> “Until benign neglect is again a possibility, conservation biology can complement natural resource fields in providing some of the theoretical and empirical foundations for coping with such management conundrums” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “What are these postulates? I propose two sets: a functional, or mechanistic, set and an ethical, or normative, set. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “**The functional postulates**. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)
> “a set of fundamental axioms, derived from ecology, biogeography, and population genetics, about the maintenance of both the form and function of natural biological systems. They suggest the rules for action. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

unsure how seemingly 'descriptive' postulates suggests "rules for action", which appear quite normative.


> “The first, the evolutionary postulate states: *Many of the species that constitute natural communities are the products of coevolutionary processes*. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)


> “This postulate merely asserts that the structure, function, and stability of coevolved, natural communities differ significantly from those of unnatural or synthetic communities. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

are managed communities considered here unnatural or synthetic?

> “There are many "corollaries" of this postulate. Strictly speaking, most of them are empirically based generalizations. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “*Species are interdependent*. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “This is not to say that every species is essential for community function, but that there is always uncertainty about the interactions of species and about the biological consequences of an extinction. Partly for this reason, Aldo Leopold (1953) admonished conservationists to save all of the parts (species) of a community. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “*Many species are highly specialized*. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “*Extinctions of keystone species can have long-range consequences*” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “*Introductions of generalists may reduce diversity*. The introduction of exotic plant and animal species may reduc ediversity,especially if they are large or generalist species (Diamond 1984, Elton 1958). Apparently,the larger the land mass, the less the impact of exotics (e.g., Simberloff 1980)..” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “The second functional postulate concernsthe scale of ecologicalprocesses: *Many, if not all, ecological processes have thresholds below and above which they become discontinuous, chaotic, or suspended” *(Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “Smallness and randomness are inseparable” (Soulé, 1985, p.729)

> “, the *temporal continuity of habitats and successional stages depends on size*” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

> “*outbursts reduce diversity*. If population densities of ecologically dominant species rise above sustainable levels, they can destroy local prey populations and other species sharing a resource with such species. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

> “*Genetic and demographic processes have thresholds below which nonadaptive, random forces begin to prevail over adaptive, deterministic forces within population* ” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)


nonstochastic factors are a threat to the aim of conservation biology of being a management science

> “The main implication of this postulate for conservation is that the probability of survival of a local population is a positive function of its size. One of the corollaries of this postulate is that below a certain population size (between 10 and 30), the probability of extinction from random demographic events increases steeply (Shaffer1981)” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

> “**The normative postulates**. The normative postulates are value statements that make up the basis of an ethic of appropriate attitudestoward other forms of life-an ecosophy (Naess 1973). They provide standards by which our actions can be measured. They are shared, I believe, by most conservationists and many biologists, although ideological purity is not my reason for proposing them. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

> “*Diversity of organisms is good*. Such a statement cannot be tested or proven. The mechanisms by which such value judgments arise in consciousness are unknown. The conceptual mind may accept or reject the idea as somehow valid or appropriate. If accepted, the idea becomes part of an individual's philosophy” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

[[diversity is at the core of conservation biology but its meanings have changed]]

Diversity as the first normative postulate. Curious, however, that value-judgements are equated also with stochasticity (being of 'unknown origin'). Philosophy is equated with personal preference... Then, this seems to have changed since then --> diversity seems to be known argued for using scientific reasons that could well fall under the "functional postulates" here. This gives a clue into how 'biodiversity' became a scientific concept --> by an artificial separation between description and value.

> “In general, humans enjoy variety. We can never know with certainty whether this is based on avoiding tedium and boredom or something else, but it may be as close to a universal norm as we can come” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

> “Natural extinction is thought to be either value free or good because it is part of the process of replacing less well-adapted gene pools with better adapted ones. Ultimately, natural extinction,unless it is catastrophic, does not reduce biological diversity, for it is offset by speciation” (Soulé, 1985, p.730)

> “It may seem logical to extend the aversion of anthropogenic extinction of populations to the suffering and untimely deaths of individuals because populations are composed of individuals. I do not believe this step is necessary or desirable for conservation biology. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

> “For this reason, biologists often overcome their emotional identification with individual victims. For example, the biologist sees the abandoned fledgling or the wounded rabbit as part of the process of natural selection and is not deceived that "rescuing" sick, abandoned, or maimed individuals is serving the species or the cause of conservation. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

> “Therefore, the ethical imperative to conserve species diversity is distinct from any societal norms about the value or the welfare of individual animals or plants. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

This coincides with the idea of conservation being a management-science

> “Conservation and animal welfare, however, are conceptually distinct, and they should remain politically separate. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.731) 

Conservation --> population (analogy to public health) Animal welfare --> individual (analogy to curative medicine)

> “*Ecological complexity is good*. This postulate parallels the first one, but assumes the value of habitat diversity and complexe cological processes” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

Looks like 'diveristy' at this stage meant species diversity, while complexity is other measures of biodiversity as said in [2002-Sarkar](2002-Sarkar.md)

> “Like the first one, this postulate expresses a preference for nature over artifice, for wilderness over gardens (cf. Dubos 1980). ” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

> “*Evolution is good*. ” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

> “*Biotic diversity has intrinsic value*, irrespective of its instrumental or utilitarian value. This normative postulate is the most fundamental. In emphasizing the inherent value of nonhuman life, it distinguishes the dualistic, exploitive world view from a more unitary perspective: Species have value in themselves, a value neither conferred nor revocable, but springing from a species' long evolutionary heritage and potential or even from the mere fact of its existence. A large literature exists on this subject (Devall and Sessions 1985; Ehrenfeld 1981; Passmore 1974; Rolston 1985, p. 718 this issue; Tobias 985; and the journal *Environmental Ethics*).” (Soulé, 1985, p.731)

> “Endless scholarly debate will probably take place about the religious, ethical, and scientific sources of this postulate and about its implications for policy and management. For example, does intrinsic value imply egalitarianism and equal rights among species? A more profitable discussion would be about the rules to be used when two or more species have conflicting interests (Naess 1985). ” (Soulé, 1985, p.732)

This kinds reminds me to what I want to do --> a conceptual history of 'intrinsic value', and it's relation to the social dimension of the postulate


> “Conservation biology is a young field, but its roots antedate science itself.” (Soulé, 1985, p.733)


> “In the past, the responses to environmental degradation were often literary, as in the Babylonian Talmud (Vol. I, Shabbath 129a, chap. xviii, p. 644), Marsh (1864), Leopold (1966), Carson (1962) and others (see Passmore 1974). More recently, legal and regulatory responses have been noticeable, especially in highly industrialized and democratized societies. Examples include the establishment of national parks and government policies on human population and family planning, pollution, forest management, and trade in endangeredspecies. At this point in history, a major threat to society and nature is technology, so it is appropriate that this generation look to science and technology to complement literary and legislative responses. 

'technology' here seems a synonym of 'industrialisation' (see also, below)

> " The current frenzy of environmental degradation is unprecedented (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1981)." (Soulé, 1985, p.733)

May want to check this --> Ehrlich, P. R., and A. H. Ehrlich. 1981. *Extinction*. Random House, New York.

> "Conservation biology and the conservation movement cannot reverse history and return the biosphere to its prelapsarian majesty. The momentum of the human population explosion, entrenched political and economic behavior, and withering technologies are propelling human kind in the opposite direction."  (Soulé, 1985, p.733)

> "It is, however, within our capacity to modify significantly the rate at which biotic diversity is destroyed, and small changes in rates can produce large effects over long periods of time." (Soulé, 1985, p.733) 

A more modest aim.

>    "Biologists can help increase the efficacy of wild land management; biologists can improve the survival odds of species in jeopardy; biologists can help mitigate technological impacts. The intellectual challenges are fascinating, the opportunities plentiful, and the results can be personally gratifying." (Soulé, 1985, p.733) 

Again, something that we see here: - conservation biology is a management science - biology is posed as a value-free activity with a positive value-laden aim (for which a necessary artificial division between description and value is needed) - technology (aka industrialisation) is seen as the enemy that cannot be avoided.
