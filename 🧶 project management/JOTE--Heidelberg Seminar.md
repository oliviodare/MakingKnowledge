## Notes meeting 12 July 2021

Composition students: med 25% + biomed 75%.

Interest for us to explain:
- knowing whitelists and blacklists.
- keep it simple and practical: what are hypothesis, and how to formulate them.
- different needs for the different students: med students need to learn and implement structure (e.g., hypothesis, testing, methodology) in their research; natural scientists need to understand the more practical dimension and nuanced aspects of the so-called 'scientific method'. The main challenge, however, will be to "getting med students to think more scientifically."
- what is a negative result, what can we learn from them?
- what are the different platform for negative results (and other interesting platforms)? *[F1000](https://f1000research.com/)*, [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/), *[Experimental Results](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/experimental-results)*, *[microPublication](https://www.micropublication.org/)*. 
- p-values and confidence intervals.
- difficulties of peer-review of negative results.
- context is cellurar/molecular biology, examples of those science is a preference.
- what are the OSCs, what can we learn from them, and how can we contribute?.
 


Schedule and format
- 2-part or 3-part seminar
- Basics in first seminar as a sort of teaser, then near their thesis writing, a more concrete lecture.
- 90 or 2/3x45, perhaps longer
- Discussion/workshop formats ideal
- Test run Februrary 2022, March/April detail

Structure of the seminars
1. Wilco: he only shows what negative results and hypothesis are in a very superficial way. I would need to build on this. However, more detailed info about content is missing (awaiting on him providing me slides/syllabus).
2. Seminar part 1: hypothesis and 'scientific method'
3. Seminar part 2: negative results (what are they, what can we say about them, and what can we learn from them).
4. Seminar part 3: scientific communication platforms, motivation alternatives and reform culture (e.g., OSCs).

Inspirations and literature
- Harry Collins, replication.
- JOTE literature, negative results
- ~~Kuhn, normal science and revolutions~~ (unclear how this relates).
