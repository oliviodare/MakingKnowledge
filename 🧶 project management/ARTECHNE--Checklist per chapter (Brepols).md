# STATUS
IMAGES:
* All images ready, and the 9 in color have been assigned.
* Brepols has the raw data of the graphs of Stols-Witlox. They told me that the typesetters will be in charge of making the graphs from the data and ensuring that the graphs fit the house style. No action need (perhaps just a reminder once delivering the book for production)
* The images that are ready for delivery can be found on the Dropbox under folder MoT Peer Reviewed > Illustrations (production ready). Files are in order and correctly named, ready for delivery. Information about images can be found in file: “MoT List of Illustrations.xlsx” under folder MoT Peer Reviewed.

TEXTS:
* All the manuscripts are clean and ready for production. The files can be found on the Dropbox under folder MoT Peer Reviewed > Manuscripts (production ready). Files are in order and correctly named, ready for delivery.
* There is only your introduction missing. I can copyedit it according to the book’s style once you’ve written it but only if it comes before the August 20TH.
* There are three chapters (Stols-Witlox, Murphy, and Osnabrugge) for which some information may be updated after typsetting. Some contain reference to other chapters within the book, so page numbers will only be known after they are typset. Also, two of the chapters contain a reference to a forthcoming book edited by Marcaida (Ingenuity in the Making. Matter and Technique in Early Modern Europe). If the book comes in time, we may be able to add page numbers. Otherwise, we can just go with ‘forthcoming’.

- [ ] If the list includes more than one work by the same author, a 2-em dash should be substituted for the name after the first appearance (see [11.4](http://www.mhra.org.uk/style/11.4)), and the works should be arranged in alphabetical order of title, disregarding initial definite or indefinite articles.
- [ ] If two or more essays in the same edited volume are cited, the bibliography should have separate entries for each essay. In general, it is sensible to avoid creating cross-references to an edited volume, especially within a very large bibliography or one with various sections.

- [ ] Is the author using footnotes, not endnotes?

- [ ]  Subsequent citations of this work can be abbreviated, but make sure this is standardized throughout (e.g. if more than one work by the author is cited, then: Chitty, *The Desert a City*, p. 1; if only one work by the author is cited, then: Chitty, p. 1).
- [ ]  Supply forenames for names of people cited.
- [ ]  Provide full references to series, and series numbers.
- [ ] Be consistent in the citation of a particular work.
- [ ] In most European languages (except English, French and Romance languages, Latin, and certain Slavonic languages), titles of books and other publications are set as in regular prose, with an initial capital or with a capitalized second word if the first is an article. In ancient and medieval Latin works, as well as most Romance languages, only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized (e.g. `De civitate Dei`).
- [ ] Are journals following the preferred capitals style of the journal?
- [ ] Use this format of citation:
