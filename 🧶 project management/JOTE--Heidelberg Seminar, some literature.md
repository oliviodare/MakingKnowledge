[[Scientific Method, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]. A good place that reviews the history of the philosophy of science in regards to the issue of knowledge inquiry and scientific method. It's good to see the different elements of the scientific method that have come and gone from the foreground and have been emphasized at the different historical times. 

A recent letter debate about the relationship between 'data' and 'hypothesis', between defenders of 'data-driven, hypothesis-free research' and those who argue that data analysis is always 'hypothesis-, protohypothesis-, or theory-laden'. Especially interesting beacuse is in the field of computational biology and genomics. [2020-Yanai and Lercher](2020-Yanai%20and%20Lercher.md), and the responses: [2021-Felin et al](2021-Felin%20et%20al.md), [2021-Yanai and Lercher](2021-Yanai%20and%20Lercher.md), and [2021b-Felin et al](2021b-Felin%20et%20al.md). 

[2021-Green et al](2021-Green%20et%20al.md). An optimistic outlook on what is like to teach philosophy of science to science students of several discipline. Resourcefull, in the sense of being explicit about the attitude that teachers can have in order to get students involved.

Blachowicz's 2009 article ['How Science Textbooks Treat Scientific Method: A Philosopher's Perspective'](https://doi.org/10.1093/bjps/axp011).

A 2021 article, entited ['Beyond Hypothesis Testing. Investigating the Diversity of Scientific Methods in Science Teachersâ€™ Understanding'](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-020-00185-9) may be useful for bringing a pluralist idea of 'scientific method', and "provides suggestions for the design of teacher training programmes and highlights the need for explicit instruction about scientific methods." Focused exclusively on secondary education, but may be useful nonetheless.
