## General aims

In terms of reading, my main objectives now would be to learn more about conceptal history as my theoretical approach, and the science of biodiversity and conservation as my object of study. 
- A good approach towards this could be to use [ConnectedPapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) inputing the literature that I read so far to discover new links.

I would also like to begin seeking out potential case-studies, for which some of the thinks that may be found on my [raindrop bookmarks](https://app.raindrop.io/my/0/%23casestudies) may be useful.
