## Discussion 20th

### 1. and 2. Mor's experience with making the visual identity book (VIB): vacation and our contribution

The book is not only a guideline to make visual objects:
- identity and mission take a central piece
- it is a product of the teams member, so it will be dynamic as the team changes

There were, however, some issues in terms of visual making. We had prepared the VIB thinking of the PDF, not so much the flyers, SM, and the website (more on point 4)

### 3. Lotty: What social media needs in term of visual material.

- Mostly for Instagram, as is them main place for visual material. 
	- Needs: fonts, logo
	- Hierarchy and sizing of fonts and colors
- On all socials: headers. 
- Logo waterprint

### 4. Logo: finalise placement of the text in the logo

#### Lotty's impressions:
- the TE in the icon is not immediately recognisable
- it's original and recognisable
- arab mystery
- looks professional, looks like we've made it


#### Agreement in logo's
- Semibold for both Blue and Yellow logos, in all backgrounds
- Yellow and Blue in white background: normal stroke thickness
- Blue in Yellow background: normal stroke thickness
- Yellow in Blue background: increased stroke thickness 
- Text placement: hierarchy (bottom right text as first, bottom allignment left as second).
