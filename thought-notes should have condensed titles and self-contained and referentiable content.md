## the title
- title should be a claim or, if question, a very specifc question. 
- if you have the answers to the question, it should *not* be formulated as a question

## the content
- it should be consice
- it should be written in my own words
- I should think of it as it would be a potential paragraph
- Ishould limit words or lines
- It's important that the content of the note should explain 1) what you mean by the title and 2) what every concept in the title means
